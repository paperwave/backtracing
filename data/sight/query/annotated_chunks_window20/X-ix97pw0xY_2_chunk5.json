Please in the case we use ordinal logit , should we report pearson correlation and omnibus test value? if it is the case, how to interpret them (for exemple, under or above p value, what it is the meaning). Also shoud we consider the sig level from the table 'Test of model effect' or 'Parameter Estimates' table to say that a relationship between the predictor and outcome variable is significant. I am really looking for ways to interpret, your answer will really help me. thanks."
