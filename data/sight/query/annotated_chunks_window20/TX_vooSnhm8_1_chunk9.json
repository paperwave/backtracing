He actually had it at 26:44 but let it slip through his hands.\nFor that you have to go back to when he was computing matrix \"V\".  The evec associated with eval of 18 was [1;-1] but it also can be written as [-1;1]\n\nHe chose the [1;-1] which had the effect once we made it to the final calculation of U * Diag^2 * V^t that it SWAPPED THE COLUMNS of A\nHis original A was [4,4;-3,3] and the calc'd one was [4,4;3,-3]\nHad he chosen the 'other version' of the evec associated with Lambda = 18 when figuring out \"V\", he would have gotten back the same \"A\" he started with instead of the column-swapped version.\nBut what could go wrong? :-)"
