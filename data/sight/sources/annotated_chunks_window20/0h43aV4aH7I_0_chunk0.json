        "text": "So coming near the end of the course, this lecture will be a mixture of the linear algebra that comes with a change of basis."
    },
    {
        "text": "And a change of basis from one basis to another basis is something you really do in applications."
    },

        "text": "So the matrix is the coordinate-based description of the linear transformation."

    {
        "text": "And, you'll notice that the stuff that sits on the board comes very clearly, but it's my motion that, that, that needs a whole lot of bits, right?"
