F sub x tells us what happens if we change x a little bit by some small amount delta x. F sub y tells us how f changes if we change y by a small amount delta y."

        "text": "If we change x by a certain amount delta x, and if we change y by the amount delta y, and let's say that we have z equals f of x, y, then that changes by an amount which is approximately f sub x times delta x plus f sub y times delta y."

    {
        "text": "The rate of change is f sub x."
