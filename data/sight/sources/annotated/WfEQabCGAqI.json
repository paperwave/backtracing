        "text": "Well, we've seen that it's given by the partial derivative f sub x."
    },

        "text": "So, this is approximately equal to f of x, y plus delta x times f sub x at the given point x, y. I'm not going to add it because notation is already long enough."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, that means my vector u is, well, approximately, because I'm using this linear approximation, delta x, zero, and f sub x times delta x. OK, is that OK with everyone?"

    {
        "text": "Good."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, what about v?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, v works the same way."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so I'm not going to do all the details."
    },
    {
        "text": "When I move from here to here, well, x doesn't change, and y changes by delta y."
    },

        "text": "y component changes by delta y."

        "text": "What about the z component?"

        "text": "Well, f changes by f sub y times delta y."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's how f changes if I increase y by delta y. OK, so I have my two sides."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, I can take the cross product."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, maybe I will first, sorry, factor something out."
    },
    {
        "text": "See, I can rewrite this as one zero f sub x times delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, this one I will rewrite as zero one f sub y delta y."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so, now the cross product, so n hat delta s up to sine is going to be u cross v. u cross v, well, so we'll have to do the cross product, and we'll have a delta x delta y coming out."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, I'm just saving myself the trouble of writing a lot of delta x and delta y's."
    },
    {
        "text": "But, if you prefer, you can just do directly this cross product there."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let's compute this cross product."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, the i component is zero minus f sub x."
    },
    {
        "text": "The y component is going to be, well, f sub y minus zero, but with a minus sign in front of everything, so negative f sub y."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, the z component will be just one times delta x delta y. OK, does that make sense for, yes, very good."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so, now, when we just take, we shrink this rectangle, we shrink delta x and delta y down, so that's how we get this formula for n ds equals negative fx negative fy one dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, plus minus because it's up to us to choose whether we want to take the normal vector pointing up or down."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, see, if you take this convention, then the z component of n ds is positive."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, that corresponds to normal vector pointing up."
    },
    {
        "text": "If you take the opposite means, then the z component will be negative."
    },
    {
        "text": "That means your normal vector points down."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so this one is with n pointing up."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, when I say up, of course, it's still perpendicular to the surface."
    },
    {
        "text": "You know, if the surface really has a big slope, then it's not really going to go all that much up, but more up than down."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that's how we get that formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "Any questions?"
    },
    {
        "text": "No?"
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that's a really useful formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, you don't really need to remember all the details of how we got it, but please remember that formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's do an example, actually."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, let's say I want to find the flux of the vector field z times k. So, it's a vertical vector point of the paraboloid z equals x squared plus y squared that lives above the unit disk."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so what does that mean?"
    },
    {
        "text": "z equals x squared plus y squared, well, we've seen it many times."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, it's this paraboloid above the unit disk means I only care about, I don't care about this infinite surface."
    },
    {
        "text": "I will actually stop when I hit a radius of one away from the z axis."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, so now I have my vector field, which is going to point overall up because, in fact, I'm at z times k. So, the more z is positive, the more your vector field goes up."
    },
    {
        "text": "Of course, if z were negative, then it would point down, but we live above."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, actually, a quick opinion poll."
    },
    {
        "text": "What do you think the flux should be?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Should it be positive, zero, negative?"
    },
    {
        "text": "We don't know."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so I see some I don't know."
    },
    {
        "text": "I see some negative, and I see some positive."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, of course, I didn't tell you which way I'm orienting my paraboloid."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, so far, both answers are correct."
    },
    {
        "text": "The only one that's probably not correct is zero because no matter which way you choose to orient it, you should get something."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not looking like it will be zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, let's say that I'm going to do it with a normal pointing upwards."
    },
    {
        "text": "Second chance."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, I see some people changing back and forth between one and two."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let's draw a picture."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which one is pointing upwards?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, let's look at the bottom point, the normal vector pointing up."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here, we know what it means."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's this guy."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so, if you continue to follow your normal vector, see, they're actually pointing up and into the paraboloid."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, and I claim that the answer should be positive because the vector field is crossing our paraboloid going upwards, going from the outside out and below to the inside and up side, so in the direction that we are counting positively."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, we'll see how it turns out when we do the calculation."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so we have to compute the integral for flux."
    },
    {
        "text": "The one integral of a surface of F dot n dS is going to be, OK, so what are we going to do?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, F, we said, is 0, 0, z."
    },
    {
        "text": "What is n dS?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, let's use our brand new formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, it says negative F sub x, negative F sub y, one dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "What is little f in here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's x squared plus y squared, OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So, when we're using this formula, we need to know what little f stands for is whatever the formula is for z as a function of x and y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, we take x squared plus y squared, and we take the partial derivatives with minus signs."
    },
    {
        "text": "We get negative 2x, negative 2y, and one dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, of course, here it didn't really matter because we're going to dot them with zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, actually, even if we had made a mistake, we somehow wouldn't have had to pay the price, still."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so we'll end up with double integral on S of z dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, what do we do with that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, we have too many things."
    },
    {
        "text": "We need to get rid of z."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, let's use z equals x squared plus y squared once more."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that becomes double integral of x squared plus y squared dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "And here, see, we're using the fact that we're only looking at things that are on the surface."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not like in a triple integral, you could never do that because z, x, and y are independent."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here, they're related by the equation of a surface."
    },
    {
        "text": "Sorry if I sound like I'm ranting, but I know from experience this is where one of the most sticky and tricky points is, actually."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so now, how will we actually integrate that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, now that we have just x and y, we should figure out what's the range for x and y?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, the range for x and y is going to be the shadow of our region."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's going to be this unit disk."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let me just do that for now."
    },
    {
        "text": "And see here, this is finally where I've left the world of surface integrals to go back to a usual double integral."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now, I have to set it up."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I can do it this way with dx dy, but it looks like there's a smarter thing to do."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, I'm going to use, actually, polar coordinates."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, in fact, I'm going to say this is a double integral of r squared times r dr d theta."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm on the unit disk, so r goes zero to one, theta goes zero to two pi."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, if you do the calculation, you'll find that this is going to be pi over two."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, any questions about the example?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yes?"
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, how do I get this negative 2x and negative 2y?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So, I want to use my formula for n ds."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, my surface is given by the graph of a function."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's the graph of a function x squared plus y squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, I will use this formula that's up here."
    },
    {
        "text": "I will take the function x squared plus y squared, and I will take its partial derivatives."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, if I take the partial of f, so, f x squared plus y squared with respect to x, I get 2x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, I put negative 2x, and then same thing, negative 2y, one dx dy, yes?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Which k hat?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, you mean the vector field?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, so it's a different part of the story, OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So, whenever you do a surface integral for flux, you have two parts of the story."
    },
    {
        "text": "One is the vector field whose flux you're taking."
    },
    {
        "text": "The other one is the surface for which you will be taking flux."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, the vector field only comes as this f in the notation."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, everything else, the bounds of the double integral and the n ds, they all come from the surface that we are looking at."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so basically, in all of this calculation, this is coming from f equals zk."
    },
    {
        "text": "Everything else comes from the information paraboloid z equals x squared plus y squared above the disk."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so in particular, if we wanted to now find the flux of any other vector field for the same paraboloid, well, all we have to do is just replace this guy by whatever the new vector field is."
    },
    {
        "text": "We've learned how to set up flux integrals for this paraboloid."
    },
    {
        "text": "Not that you should remember this one by heart."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, there's many paraboloids in life and other surfaces, too, so it's better to remember the general method."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, any other questions?"
    },
    {
        "text": "No?"
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, let's see more ways of tackling flux integrals."
    },

        "text": "But, just to reassure you, at this point, we've seen the most important ones."

        "text": "But, you can also just stay with a normal vector."

        "text": "If you have a plane, Ax plus By plus Cz equals D, then the normal vector would just be A, B, C. If you have a surface S given by an equation, g of x, y, z equals zero, then you can take the normal vector to be the gradient of g. We've seen that the gradient is perpendicular to the level surface."

        "text": "Now, of course, we don't necessarily have to follow what's going to come because if we could solve for z then we might be better off doing what we did over there."

        "text": "Well, I'm going to give you a little bit of information about NDS."

        "text": "OK, so let's say that my surface is just a slanted plane."

    {
        "text": "So, my normal vector would be maybe somewhere here."
    },

        "text": "And, let's say that I'm going to try, you know, I need, of course, some handle on how to set up my integral."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, maybe I'm going to express this in terms of x and y. OK, so I have my coordinates, and I'll try to use x and y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, then I would like to relate delta s, ds, to the area in the xy plane."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, that means, you know, I want maybe to look at the projection of this guy onto a horizontal plane."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's squish it horizontally."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, then you have here another area."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so the guy on the slanted plane, let's call that delta s, and let's call this guy down here delta a."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, the question, and, you know, delta a would become ultimately maybe delta x, delta y, or something like that."
    },
    {
        "text": "The question is, how do we find the conversion rate between these two areas?"
    },
    {
        "text": "See, I mean, they're not the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "Visually, I hope it's clear to you that if my plane is actually horizontal, then, of course, they're the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "But, the more slanted it becomes, the more delta a becomes smaller than delta s, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, if you buy, you know, if you buy land, and it's on the side of a cliff, well, whether you look at it on a map, or whether you look at it on the actual cliff, the area is going to be very different."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm not sure if that's a wise thing to do if you want to build a house there, but I've been told you can get really cheap land."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so anyway, OK, so delta s versus delta a depends on how slanted things are."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, let's try to make that more precise by looking at the angle that our plane makes with the horizontal direction."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let's call this angle alpha, the angle that our plane makes with the horizontal direction."
    },
    {
        "text": "See, it's all coming together now."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first unit about cross products, normal vectors, and so on is actually useful now."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, I claim that the surface element is related to the area in the plane by delta a equals delta s times the cosine of alpha."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why is that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, let's look at this small rectangle with one horizontal side and one slanted side."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, when you project, this side doesn't change."
    },
    {
        "text": "But, this side gets shortened by a factor of cosine alpha."
    },
    {
        "text": "Whatever this length was, this length here is that one times cosine alpha."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, that's why the area gets shrunk by cosine alpha."
    },
    {
        "text": "In one direction, nothing happens."
    },
    {
        "text": "In the other direction, you squish by cosine alpha."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, what that means is that, well, OK, so we'll have to deal with this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, of course, the one we'll care about actually is delta s expressed in terms of delta a."
    },
    {
        "text": "But, what are we going to do with this cosine?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not very convenient to have a cosine left in here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, remember, the angle between two planes, it's the same thing as the angle between the normal vectors."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, if you want to see this angle alpha elsewhere, what you can do is you can just take the vertical direction."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's take k. Then, here we have our angle alpha again."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, in particular, cosine of alpha, I can get, well, we know how to find the angle between two vectors."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, if we have our normal vector n, we'll do n dot k, and we'll divide by length n length k. Well, length k is one."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's one easy."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that's how we find the angle."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, now I'm going to say, well, delta s is going to be one over cosine alpha delta a."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, I can rewrite that as length of n divided by n dot k times delta a."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, let's multiply that by the unit normal vector because what I'm multiplying by is not dS, but actually n dS."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, n delta s will be, I'm just going to multiply by n. Well, let's think for a second."
    },
    {
        "text": "What happens if I take the unit normal n, and I multiply it by the length of my other normal big N?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I get big N again, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "This is a normal vector of the same length as n, well, up to sine."
    },
    {
        "text": "But, actually, maybe I should."
    },
    {
        "text": "The only thing I don't know is whether this guy will be going in the same direction as big N or in the opposite direction."
    },
    {
        "text": "Say that, for example, my capital N has length, I don't know, length three, for example."
    },
    {
        "text": "The unit normal vector might be this guy, in which case, indeed, three times little n will be big N. Or, it might be this one, in which case, three times little n will be negative big N. But, up to sine, it's N. And then, I will have N over n dot k delta a."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so, the final formula, the one that actually we care about in case you don't really like my explanations of how we get there, is that N dS is plus or minus N over N dot k dx dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "That one is actually kind of useful, so let's box it."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, just in case you are wondering, of course, if you didn't want to project to x, y, you would have maybe preferred to project to, say, the plane of a blackboard, yz."
    },

        "text": "Well, you can do the same thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "To express N dS in terms of dy dz, you do the same argument."
    },
    {
        "text": "And simply, the only thing that changes is instead of using the vertical vector k, you use the normal vector i."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, you would be doing N over N dot i dy dz, and same thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "Just keep an open mind that this also works with other variables."
    },
    {
        "text": "But anyway, so that's how you can basically project the vector surface area element onto the x, y plane in a way."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let's look at the special case just to see how this fits with stuff we've seen before."

        "text": "OK, that's a strange way to write the equation z equals f of x, y that we saw before."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now, it looks like, well, some function of x, y, z equals zero."

        "text": "So, let's try to use this new method."

    {
        "text": "So, let's call this guy g of x, y, z."

        "text": "Well, so now let's look at the normal vector."

        "text": "What's the gradient of this function?"
    },

        "text": "So, gradient of g, well, partial g, partial x, that's just negative partial f, partial x. Gradient g, sorry, the y component, partial g, partial y is going to be negative f sub y."
    },
    {
        "text": "And, g sub z is just one."
    },
    {
        "text": "So now, if you take n over n dot k dx dy, well, it looks like that's going to be negative f sub x, negative f sub y, one divided by, well, what's n dot k?"

        "text": "If you do that with k, you'll get just one."

        "text": "See, that's, again, our favorite formula."
