        "text": "And now, one thing I didn't have time to tell you about, but hopefully you heard about in recitation yesterday, is the approximation formula that tells you what happens if you vary both x and y. F sub x tells us what happens if we change x a little bit by some small amount delta x. F sub y tells us how f changes if we change y by a small amount delta y."

    {
        "text": "If we do both at the same time, then the two effects will add up with each other."
    },

        "text": "Because you can imagine that first you will change x and then you will change y or the other way around."

    {
        "text": "If we change x by a certain amount delta x, and if we change y by the amount delta y, and let's say that we have z equals f of x, y, then that changes by an amount which is approximately f sub x times delta x plus f sub y times delta y."

    },

        "text": "That would be z equals z0 plus a times the change in x, x minus x0."

    },
    {
        "text": "Another way to do it, of course, would be to write actually parametric equations of these lines, get vectors along them and then take the cross-product to get the normal vector to the plane, and then get this equation for the plane using the normal vector."
    },

        "text": "That also works and it gives you the same formula."

        "text": "The first observation is that if we have a local minimum or a local maximum, then both partial derivative, partial f, partial x and partial f, partial y are both zero at the same time."

        "text": "Why is that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, let's say that f sub x is zero."

        "text": "That means when I vary x, well, to first order the function doesn't change."

    },
    {
        "text": "Well, why is that enough?"
    },

        "text": "It is essentially enough because of this formula telling me that if both of these guys are zero then to first order the function doesn't change."
    },

        "text": "It starts with 2x minus 2y plus zero plus two."
    },
    {
        "text": "Remember that y is a constant so this differentiates to zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, if we do f sub y, that is going to be zero minus 2x plus 6y minus two."
    },
    {
        "text": "And what we want to do is set these things equal to zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we want to solve these two equations at the same time."
    },
    {
        "text": "An important thing to remember, maybe I should have told you a couple of weeks ago already, if you have two equations to solve, well, it is very good to try to simplify them by adding them together or whatever."

        "text": "Well, now it tells us, if you put y equals zero, that tells you 2x plus 2 equals zero."

        "text": "Remember, we saw the example of x squared plus y squared that has a critical point."
    },

        "text": "The critical point is obviously a minimum."
    },

    {
        "text": "But then elsewhere the function drops to a lower value."
    },
    {
        "text": "We call that just a local minimum to say that it is a minimum if you stick to values that are close enough to that point."
    },
    {
        "text": "Of course, you also have a local maximum."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I did not plot it, but it is easy to plot."
    },
    {
        "text": "That is a local maximum."
    },

        "text": "But there is a third example of critical point, and that is a saddle point."

        "text": "The saddle point is a new phenomenon that you do not really see in a single variable calculus."
    },
    {

        "text": "The point in the middle at the origin is a saddle point."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "At the mountain pass the ground is horizontal."

        "text": "But, depending on which direction you go, you go up or down."

        "text": "But, 2x minus 2y, well, that is twice x minus y."

        "text": "In fact, I can simplify this further to x minus y plus one squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "See, that would start like, maybe I should put parentheses here, that would be x minus y squared plus twice x minus y."
    },

        "text": "And then there is a plus one."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, let me find that minus one here."
    },

        "text": "And I still have my 2y squared."
