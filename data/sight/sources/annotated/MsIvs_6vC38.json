        "text": "E three two inverse, right, because I multiply from the left by E three two inverse, that'll pop it up next to U."

        "text": "So B, B costs a lot less, obviously."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because it's just one column."
    },
    {
        "text": "We carry it through elimination and then actually we do back substitution."

        "text": "Let me just tell you the answer there."
    },

        "text": "It's n squared."

        "text": "So the cost for every right-hand side is n squared."
    },

        "text": "For the right, for the cost of B, of B, turns out to be n squared."
    },

        "text": "So you see, if we have, as we often have, a matrix A and several right-hand sides, then we pay the price on A, the higher price on A, to get it split up into L and U, to do elimination on A, but then we can process every right-hand side at low cost."
    },

        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the, that's, we really have discussed the most fundamental algorithm of, of, for a system of equations."
    },

        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "So, I'm ready to allow row exchanges."

        "text": "So these are the matrices that I need to do row exchanges."

        "text": "And I may have to do two row exchanges."
    },
    {
        "text": "Is it, can you invent a matrix where I would have to do two row exchanges and then it would come out fine?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yeah, let's just, for the heck of it, so I'll put it here."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let me do three by threes."
    },
    {
        "text": "Actually, why don't I just plain list all the three by three permutation matrices?"
    },
    {
        "text": "They're a nice little group of them."
    },
    {
        "text": "What are all the matrices that exchange no rows at all?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I'll include the identity."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's a permutation matrix that doesn't do anything."

        "text": "Actually, I'll, yeah."

        "text": "Let me not clutter this up."
    },

        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "Give me a complete list of all the row exchange matrices."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what are they?"
    },
    {
        "text": "They're all the ways I can take the identity matrix and rearrange its rows."
    },

        "text": "How many will there be?"
    },
    {
        "text": "How many three by three permutation matrices?"
    },

        "text": "Shall we keep going and get the answer?"
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "Now what else?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Switch, what will be the next easy one is switch two and three."
    },
    {
        "text": "Good."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'll leave one zero zero alone and I'll switch, I'll move number three up and number two down."
    },
    {
        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "Those are the ones that just exchange single, a pair of rows."
    },
    {
        "text": "This guy, this guy and this guy exchanges a pair of rows."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now there are more possibilities."
    },
    {
        "text": "What are the, what's left?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So tell me, there is another one here."
    },
    {
        "text": "What's that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's going to move, it's going to change all rows, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Where shall we put them?"
    },

        "text": "So give me a first row."

        "text": "Zero one zero."

        "text": "Okay, now a second row, say zero zero one and the third guy one zero zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that is like a cycle."
    },
    {
        "text": "That puts row two moves up to row one, row three moves up to row two, and row one moves down to row three."
    },
    {
        "text": "And there's one more, which is, let's see, what's left?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Is it zero zero one, okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "One zero zero, okay."

        "text": "Zero one zero, okay."

    },
    {
        "text": "So if I multiply, but I don't know."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if I invert, then I'm just doing row exchanges to get back again, so the inverses are all there."
    },

        "text": "It's a little family of matrices that, like, they've got their own, if I multiply, I'm still inside this group, if I invert, I'm inside this group."

        "text": "Actually, group is the right name for this."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's a group of six matrices."

        "text": "And what about the inverses?"

        "text": "What's the inverse of this guy, for example?"

        "text": "What's the inverse, if I exchange rows one and two, what's the inverse matrix?"

    },

        "text": "The inverse of that matrix is, if I exchange rows one and two, then what I should do to get back to where I started is?"
    },

        "text": "The same thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this thing is its own inverse."

        "text": "This is, that's probably its own inverse."

        "text": "This is probably not, actually, I think these are inverses of each other."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh yeah, actually, the inverse is the transpose."
    },

        "text": "There's a curious fact about permutation matrices, that the inverses are the transpose."
