        "text": "And the job is to make some sense out of it."

        "text": "Just to make that part right."

        "text": "OK, what's the algorithm?"

    {
        "text": "Well, if I've chosen a partition, the a's and the b's have separated them, then that tells me what the x and the y should be."

        "text": "Now, I take those two centroids."

        "text": "So step one is, for a given a's and b's, find the centroids x and y."
    },

        "text": "Then the second step is, given the centroids x and y, given those positions, given x and y, they won't be centroids when you see what happens."

        "text": "Given x and y, reform the best partition, best clusters."

        "text": "OK, so step one, we had a guess at what the best clusters were."
    },

        "text": "Now, we start with the centroids, and we form new clusters again."

        "text": "So you'll have to tell me what I mean by the best clusters."

        "text": "If I've got the two points, x and y, I want the points, I want to separate all the points that cluster around x to the ones that cluster around y."

        "text": "And then they're probably different from my original start."

        "text": "Now I repeat step one."

        "text": "So how do I decide that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Just whichever one it's closer to."

    {
        "text": "So each point goes with each node."
    },

        "text": "I could say each node goes with the closer of x and y."
    },

        "text": "So points that should have been that are closer to x, now we're going to put them in the cluster around x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And does that solve the problem?"
    },
    {
        "text": "No, because, well, it might, but it might not."
    },
    {
        "text": "We have to come back to step one."
    },
    {
        "text": "We've now changed the clusters."
    },
    {
        "text": "They'll have different centroids."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we repeat step one, find the centroids for the two new clusters."
    },
    {
        "text": "Then we come to step two, find the ones that should go with the two centroids, and back and forth."
    },
    {
        "text": "I don't know, I don't think there's a nice theory of convergence or rate of convergence, all the questions that this course is always asking."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it's a very popular algorithm, k-means."
    },
    {
        "text": "k would be to have k clusters."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's a, I'm not going to discuss the, I'd rather discuss some other ways to do this, to solve this problem, but that's one sort of hack that works quite well."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so second approach is what's coming next, second solution method."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it's called the spectral clustering."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the name of the method."
    },
    {
        "text": "And before I write down what you do, what does the word spectral mean?"
    },
    {
        "text": "You see spectral graph theory, spectral clustering."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in other parts of mathematics, you see that word, you see spectral theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "I gave you the most, and I described it as the most important, perhaps, theorem in linear algebra, at least one of the top three."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'll write it over here, because it's not, it doesn't, this is a, it's the same word spectral."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, let me ask the question again."
    },
    {
        "text": "What's that word spectral about?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What does that mean?"
    },
    {
        "text": "That means that if I have a matrix and I want to talk about its spectrum, what is the spectrum of the matrix?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It is the eigenvalues."
    },
    {
        "text": "So spectral theory, spectral clustering is using the eigenvalues of some matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what that spectral is telling me."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the spectral theorem, of course, is that for a symmetric matrix S, the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors are orthogonal."
    },
    {
        "text": "And don't forget what the real full statement is here, because there could be repeated real eigenvalues."
    },
    {
        "text": "And what does the spectral theorem tell me?"
    },
    {
        "text": "For symmetric matrices, if lambda equal 5 is repeated four times, if it's a four times solution of the equation that gives eigenvalues, then what's the conclusion?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Then there are four independent orthogonal eigenvectors to go with it."
    },
    {
        "text": "We can't say that about matrices, about all matrices, but we can say it about all symmetric matrices."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in fact, those eigenvectors are orthogonal, so we're even saying more."
    },
    {
        "text": "We can find four orthogonal eigenvectors that go with a multiplicity for eigenvalue."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, that's spectral theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "Spectral clustering starts with the graph Laplacian matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "Matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "May I remember what that matrix is?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Because that's the key connection of linear algebra to graph theory, is the properties of this graph Laplacian matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so let me say L for Laplacian."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that matrix, one way to describe it is as a transpose A, where A is the incidence matrix of the graph."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or another way we'll see is the D, the degree matrix."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "Shall I call it B for the moment?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And what matrix is B?"
    },

        "text": "That's the adjacency matrix."

        "text": "Edges and nodes."

    {
        "text": "So it's rectangular, but I'm forming A transpose A here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm forming a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this Laplacian is symmetric positive semi-definite."

        "text": "Yeah, let me just recall what all these matrices are for a simple graph."

    },
    {
        "text": "All right."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so the incidence matrix, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 edges, so five rows."
    },
    {
        "text": "There are four nodes, 1, 2, 3, and 4, so four columns."
    },
    {
        "text": "And a typical row would be edge 1 going from node 1 to node 2, so it would have a minus 1 and a 1 there."

        "text": "That's simple."
    },
    {
        "text": "The degree matrix, well, A transpose A, this is m by n. This is n by m, so it's n by n. OK, in this case, 4 by 4."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the degree matrix will be 4 by 4, n by n. And it will tell us the degree of that, which means which we just count the edges."
    },

        "text": "So it's three edges going in, node 2, three edges going in."
    },
    {
        "text": "Node 3 has just two edges, and node 4 has just two edges."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the degree matrix."

        "text": "And then the adjacency matrix that I've called B is also 4 by 4."
    },

        "text": "And what is it?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It tells us which node is connected to which node."

    {
        "text": "So I don't allow nodes, edges, that connect a node to itself, so 0s on the diagonal."
    },
    {
        "text": "So which nodes are connected to node 1?"
    },

        "text": "Well, all of 2 and 4 and 3 are connected to 1, so I have 1s there."

        "text": "Node 2, all three nodes are connected to node 2."

        "text": "So I'll have the second column and row will have all three 1s."

    {
        "text": "That dot product is just add up the components."
