        "text": "And so what we actually want is to have something which is small enough so we can actually have some averaging going on."

        "text": "And this will be, in pretty much all respects, the best estimator you can think of."

    {
        "text": "Or I could actually just maybe put some prior knowledge about how humans have time to have families."

    },
    {
        "text": "But I think that probably all of you intuitively guess that this is probably a good idea to start putting this kind of assumption rather than allowing for any number in the first place, because this eventually will be injected into the precision of our estimator."

        "text": "All right, so now let's say we actually agree that we have numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "And here I put seven numbers."
    },

        "text": "So I just said, well, now the numbers, let's assume that the numbers I'm going to get are going to be 1 all the way to, say, this number that I denote by larger than or equal to 7, which is a placeholder for any number larger than 7."
    },

        "text": "Because I know maybe I don't want to distinguish between people who have 9 or 25 siblings."

        "text": "The ultimate goal of statistics is to say what distribution your data came from, because that's basically the best you're going to be able to."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now admittedly, if I started looking at the fraction of 1's, and the fraction of 2's, and the fraction of 3's, et cetera, I would actually eventually get those numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "Just like looking at the fraction of 1's gave me a good estimate for p in the Bernoulli case, it would do the same in this case."

        "text": "It's a pretty intuitive idea."
    },

        "text": "Everybody agrees with that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "If I look at the proportion of 1's, the proportion of 2's, the proportion of 3's, that should actually give me something that gets closer and closer as my sample size increases to what I want."
    },
    {
        "text": "But the problem is, if my sample size is not huge, here I have seven numbers to estimate."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if I have 20 observations, the ratio is not really in my favor."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, 20 observations to estimate seven parameters, some of them are going to be pretty off, typically the ones with the large values."
    },
    {
        "text": "If I have only 20 students, look at the list of numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "I don't know how many numbers I have, but it probably is close to 20, maybe 15 or something."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so if you look at this list, nobody has four or more siblings in this list."
    },
    {
        "text": "There's no such person."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that means that eventually, from this data set, my estimates, so those numbers I denote by, say, p1, p2, p3, et cetera, those estimates, p4 hat would be equal to what from this data?"
    },
    {
        "text": "0, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And p5 hat would be equal to 0, and p6 hat would be equal to 0, and p larger than or equal to 7 hat would be equal to 0."

        "text": "That would be my estimates from this data set."
    },

        "text": "It's pretty clear that, in average, there's more than 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "The proportion of the population of households that have four children or more is definitely more than 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it means that my data set is not representative."
    },
    {
        "text": "And what I'm going to try to do is to find a model that tries to use the data that I have for the smaller values that I can observe and just pull shit out for the other ones."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so what we can do is to just reduce those parameters into something that's understood."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is part of the modeling that I talked about in the first place."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, how do you succinctly describe a number of something?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, one thing that you do is the Poisson distribution."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why the Poisson?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, there's many reasons."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, again, that's part of statistical modeling."

        "text": "But once you know that you have number of something that can be modeled by a Poisson, why not try a Poisson?"
    },
    {
        "text": "You could just fit a Poisson."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the Poisson is something that looks like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I guess you've all seen it."
    },
    {
        "text": "But if x follows a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda, then the probability that x is equal to little x is equal to lambda to the x over factorial x e to the minus lambda."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if you did the sheet that I gave you on the first day, you can check that those numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is, of course, for x equals 0, 1, et cetera."
    },
    {
        "text": "So x is in natural integers."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if you sum from x equals 0 to infinity, this thing, you get e to the lambda."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so they cancel."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you have a sum which is equal to 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's indeed a PMF."
    },
    {
        "text": "But what's key about this PMF is that it never takes value 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "This thing is always strictly positive."
    },
    {
        "text": "So whatever value of lambda I find from this data will give me something that's certainly more interesting than just putting the value 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "But more importantly, rather than having to estimate seven parameters, and as a consequence, you actually have to estimate 1, 2, 3, 4 of them, and it equals to 0, I have only one parameter to estimate, which is lambda."
    },
    {
        "text": "The problem with doing this is that now lambda may not be just something as simple as computing the average number."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, in this case, it will."
    },
    {
        "text": "But in many instances, it's actually not clear that this parametrization with lambda that I chose, I'm going to be able to estimate lambda just by computing the average number that I see."
    },
    {
        "text": "It will be the case."
    },
    {
        "text": "But if it's not, remember this example of the exponential we did in the last lecture."
    },
    {
        "text": "We could use the delta method and things like that to estimate this."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so here's the modeling 101."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the purpose of modeling is to restrict the space of possible distributions to a subspace that's actually plausible, but much simpler for me to estimate."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we went from all distributions on seven parameters, which is a large space that's a lot of things, to something which is just one number to estimate."
    },

        "text": "This number is positive."
    },

        "text": "Any questions about the purpose of doing this?"

        "text": "OK, so we're going to have to do a little bit of formalism now."
    },

        "text": "And so if we want to talk, this is a specific class, so I'm not going to want to talk about the Poisson model specifically every single time."
    },

        "text": "I'm going to want to talk about generic models."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then you're going to be able to plug in your favorite word, no Poisson, binomial, exponential, uniform, all these words that you've seen, you're going to be able to plug in there."
    },
    {
        "text": "But we're just going to have some generic notation and some generic terminology for statistical models."
    },

        "text": "OK?"

    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },

        "text": "And so, sorry, that's a statistical experiment, I should say."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm sorry."
    },

        "text": "OK, so I hope you're up to date with your Greek letters."

    },
    {
        "text": "All right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So for example, this could be a Poisson with parameter theta, or a Bernoulli with parameter theta."

        "text": "OK, or an exponential with parameter, I don't know, 1 over theta squared, if you want."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, but they're just indexed by theta."
    },

        "text": "For each theta, this completely describes the distribution."
    },
    {
        "text": "It could be more complicated."
    },

        "text": "This theta could be a pair of mu sigma squared, and that could actually give you some n mu sigma squared."
    },

        "text": "OK, so anything where you can actually, rather than actually giving you a full distribution, I can compress it into a parameter."
    },

        "text": "When I started saying that, I said, well, but then that could be that there are several parameters that give me the same distribution, right?"

        "text": "And that's really to be fancy."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what I really mean is that if theta is different from theta prime, then P of theta is different from P of theta prime."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or if you prefer to think about the contrapositive of this, this is the same as saying that if P theta gives me the same distribution as theta prime, then that implies that theta must be equal to theta prime."
    },
    {
        "text": "So in logic, those two things are equivalent."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "And this is something we're going to want."

        "text": "If I tell you, I mean, if those things are in probability books, it means that they were probably thought through."

    },
    {
        "text": "OK."

    },

        "text": "Because if I draw, if I have 0, and I draw my Gaussian around mu, then the probability of this Bernoulli being 1 is really the area under the curve here."

        "text": "But we can actually compute this, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So the parameter p that I'm looking for here as a function of mu and sigma is simply the probability that some y is non-negative, which is the probability that y minus mu divided by sigma is larger than minus mu divided by sigma."
    },

        "text": "By the way, when you studied probability, is that some operation you were used to making, removing the mean and dividing by the standard deviation?"

        "text": "1 minus phi of mu over sigma, right?"

        "text": "Agreed?"

        "text": "All I'm going to be able to get is mu over sigma."
