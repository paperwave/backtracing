        "text": "Because of the memorylessness property, the past of that light bulb doesn't matter."

        "text": "For both of them, the time until they burn out is going to be described an exponential distribution."

    {
        "text": "The time until the second arrival is the sum of two independent exponential random variables."

        "text": "This k is just the parameter of the distribution."
    },
    {
        "text": "We're talking about the k-th arrival, so k is a fixed number."
    },
    {
        "text": "Lambda is another parameter of the distribution, which is the arrival rate So it's a PDF over the Y's, whereas lambda and k are parameters of the distribution."

        "text": "OK."

        "text": "So Poisson was a mathematician, but Poisson also means fish in French."
    },

        "text": "At any given point in time, you have a little probability that a fish would be caught."
    },
    {
        "text": "And whether you catch one now is sort of independent about whether at some later time a fish will be caught or not."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's just make this assumption."
    },
    {
        "text": "And suppose that the rules of the game are that you-- Fish are being called it the certain rate of 0.6 per hour."
    },
    {
        "text": "You fish for 2 hours, no matter what."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then there are two possibilities."
    },
    {
        "text": "If I have caught a fish, I stop and go home."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if some fish have been caught, so there's at least 1 arrival during this interval, I go home."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or if nothing has being caught, I continue fishing until I catch something."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then I go home."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the description of what is going to happen."

        "text": "Therefore, this is just this quantity."
    },
    {
        "text": "The probability of catching 2 fish in-- of catching 0 fish in the next 2 hours, and according to the formula that we have, this is going to be e to the minus lambda times how much time we have."
    },
    {
        "text": "There's another way of thinking about this."
    },
    {
        "text": "The probability that I fish for more than 2 hours is the probability that the first catch happens after time 2, which would be the integral from 2 to infinity of the density of the first arrival time."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that density is an exponential."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you do the integral of an exponential, and, of course, you would get the same answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. That's easy."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what's the probability of fishing for more than 2 but less than 5 hours?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What does it take for this to happen?"
    },
    {
        "text": "For this to happen, we need to catch 0 fish from time 0 to 2 and catch the first fish sometime between 2 and 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if you-- one way of thinking about what's happening here might be to say that there's a Poisson process that keeps going on forever."
    },
    {
        "text": "But as soon as I catch the first fish, instead of continuing fishing and obtaining those other fish I just go home right now."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now the fact that I go home before time 5 means that, if I were to stay until time 5, I would have caught at least 1 fish."
    },
    {
        "text": "I might have caught more than 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the event of interest here is that the first catch happens between times 2 and 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "So one way of calculating this quantity would be-- Its the probability that the first catch happens between times 2 and 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "Another way to deal with it is to say, this is the probability that I caught 0 fish in the first 2 hours and then the probability that I catch at least 1 fish during the next 3 hours."
    },
    {
        "text": "This."
    },
    {
        "text": "What is this?"
    },
    {
        "text": "The probability of 0 fish in the next 3 hours is the probability of 0 fish during this time."
    },
    {
        "text": "1 minus this is the probability of catching at least 1 fish, of having at least 1 arrival, between times 2 and 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "If there's at least 1 arrival between times 2 and 5, then I would have gone home by time 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "So both of these, if you plug-in numbers and all that, of course, are going to give you the same answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now next, what's the probability that I catch at least 2 fish?"
    },
    {
        "text": "In which scenario are we?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Under this scenario, I go home when I catch my first fish."
    },
    {
        "text": "So in order to catch at least 2 fish, it must be in this case."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the same as the event that I catch at least 2 fish during the first 2 time steps."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's going to be the probability from 2 to infinity, the probability that I catch 2 fish, or that I catch 3 fish, or I catch more than that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's this quantity."
    },
    {
        "text": "k is the number of fish that I catch."
    },
    {
        "text": "At least 2, so k goes from 2 to infinity."
    },
    {
        "text": "These are the probabilities of catching a number k of fish during this interval."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if you want a simpler form without an infinite sum, this would be 1 minus the probability of catching 0 fish, minus the probability of catching 1 fish, during a time interval of length 2."
    },
    {
        "text": "Another way to think of it."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to catch 2 fish, at least 2 fish, if and only if the second fish caught in this process happens before time 2."
    },

        "text": "So that's another way of thinking about the same event."

    },

        "text": "So what's the expected number caught between time 0 and 2?"

    },

        "text": "So for a typical bus."

    {
        "text": "We picked a time at random."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if the picture is, let's say, this way, I'm much more likely to pick this interval and therefore this interarrival time, rather than that interval."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because, this interval corresponds to very few times."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I'm picking a time at random and, in some sense, let's say, uniform, so that all times are equally likely, I'm much more likely to fall inside a big interval rather than a small interval."
    },
    {
        "text": "So a person who shows up at the bus stop at a random time."

        "text": "They're selecting an interval in a biased way, with the bias favor of longer intervals."

        "text": "The phenomenon that we had in this particular example also shows up in general, whenever you have other kinds of arrival processes."
    },

        "text": "So the Poisson process is the simplest arrival process there is, where the interarrival times are exponential random variables."

        "text": "There's a larger class of models."
    },

        "text": "They're called renewal processes, in which, again, we have a sequence of successive arrivals, interarrival times are identically distributed and independent, but they may come from a general distribution."
    },

        "text": "So to make the same point of the previous example but in a much simpler setting, suppose that bus interarrival times are either 5 or 10 minutes apart."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you get some intervals that are of length 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "You get some that are of length 10."
    },

        "text": "And suppose that these are equally likely."

    },
    {
        "text": "Do we have as many 5s as 10s?"

        "text": "And I have one 1/3 probability of falling inside an interval of duration 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's because, out of the whole real line, 2/3 of it is covered by intervals of length 10, just because they're longer."

        "text": "1/3 is covered by the smaller intervals."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now if I fall inside an interval of length 10 and I measure the length of the interval that I fell into, that's going to be 10."
    },
    {
        "text": "But if I fall inside an interval of length 5 and I measure how long it is, I'm going to get a 5."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that, of course, is going to be different than 7.5."

        "text": "OK. And which number should be bigger?"

        "text": "It's the second number that's bigger because this one is biased in favor of the longer intervals."
