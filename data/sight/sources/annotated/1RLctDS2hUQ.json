        "text": "I'm going to evaluate it at 0 and at b and subtract."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's going to be b cubed over 3 minus 0 cubed over 3."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which, of course, is b cubed over 3."
    },

        "text": "That's one hump."
    },

        "text": "And so the answer is, it's the integral from 0 to pi of sin x, dx."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so I need to take the antiderivative of that."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's minus cos x."

        "text": "Now, let's do this one carefully."

        "text": "It's hard to pay attention and plug in the right numbers."

        "text": "I'm plugging in pi."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's minus cos pi."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the first term."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then I'm subtracting the value at the bottom."
    },

        "text": "Which is minus cos 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "There are already five opportunities for you to make a transcription error or an arithmetic mistake in what I just did."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I've seen all five of them."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the next one is that this is minus, minus 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Minus negative 1, if you like."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then this is minus, and here's another negative 1."
    },

        "text": "So all together we have 2."

        "text": "So that's it."
    },

        "text": "The third example is maybe superfluous, but I'm going to say it anyway."
    },
    {

    },

        "text": "Any power now is within our power."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's do it here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here we have the antiderivative is x to the 101 divided by 101."
    },
    {
        "text": "Evaluated at 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that is just 1 over 101."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the fundamental theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, this, as I say, harnesses a lot of what we've already learned all about antiderivatives."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, I want to give you an intuitive interpretation."
    },

        "text": "So let's try that."

        "text": "We'll talk about a proof of the fundamental theorem a little bit later."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not actually that hard."
    },
    {
        "text": "But we'll give an intuitive reason, interpretation, if you like, of the fundamental theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is going to be one which is not related to area, but rather to time and distance."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we'll consider x of t is your position at time t. And then x' of t, which is the rate of change of x with respect to t, is going to be what we know as your speed."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then what the theorem is telling us is the following."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's telling us the integral from a to b of v of t dt, so reading the relationship, is equal to x of b minus x of a."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so this is some kind of cumulative sum of your velocities."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's interpret the right-hand side first."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is the distance traveled."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it's also what you would read on your odometer."
    },
    {
        "text": "From the beginning to the end of the trip."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what you would read on your odometer."
    },
    {
        "text": "Whereas this is what you would read on your speedometer."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the interpretation."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, I want to just go one step further into this interpretation to make the connection with the Riemann sums that we had yesterday."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because those are very complicated to understand."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I want you to understand them viscerally on several different levels."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because that's how you'll understand integration better."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first thing that I want to imagine, so we're going to do a thought experiment now, which is that you are extremely obsessive."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you're driving your car from time a to time b."
    },
    {
        "text": "Place q to place r, whatever."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you check your speedometer every second."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you've read your speedometer in the i-th second."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you've read that you're going at this speed."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, how far do you go in that second?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, the answer is, you go this speed times the time interval, which in this case we're imagining is 1 second."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is how far you went."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is the time interval."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is the distance traveled in second number i, in the i-th second."
    },
    {
        "text": "The distance traveled in the i-th second."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the total distance you traveled."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, what happens if you go the whole distance?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, you travel the sum of all these distances."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's some massive sum where n is some ridiculous number of seconds."
    },
    {
        "text": "3600 seconds or something like that, whatever it is."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's going to turn out to be very similar to what you would read on your odometer."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because during that second, you didn't change velocity very much."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the approximation, the speed at one time that you spotted it, is very similar to the speed during the whole second."
    },
    {
        "text": "It doesn't change that much."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is a pretty good approximation to how far you traveled."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so the sum is a very realistic approximation to the entire integral, which is denoted this way."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which, by the fundamental theorem, is exactly how far you traveled."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is x sub b minus x sub a."
    },
    {
        "text": "Exactly."
    },
    {
        "text": "The other one is approximate."
    },
    {
        "text": "Again, this is called a Riemann sum."
    },
    {
        "text": "Alright, so that's the intro to the fundamental theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now what I need to do is extend it just a bit."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the way I'm going to extend it is the following."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to do it on this example first."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then we'll do it more formally."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here's this example where we went someplace."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now I just want to draw you an additional picture here."
    },
    {
        "text": "Imagine I start here, and I go over to there, and then I come back."
    },
    {
        "text": "And maybe even I do a round trip."
    },
    {
        "text": "I come back to the same place."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, if I come back to the same place, then the position is unchanged from the beginning to the end."
    },
    {
        "text": "In other words, the difference is 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the velocity, technically rather than the speed, it's the speed to the right and the speed to the left maybe are the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "But one of them is going in the positive direction, one of them is going in the negative direction, and they cancel each other."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if you have this kind of situation, we want that to be reflected."
    },
    {
        "text": "We like that interpretation."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we want to preserve it even in the case when the function v is negative."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so I'm going to now extend our notion of integration."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we'll extend integration to the case f negative."
    },

        "text": "Or positive."
    },
    {
        "text": "In other words, it could be any sign."
    },

        "text": "Actually, there's no change."
    },

        "text": "The formulas are all the same."

        "text": "We just, if this v is going to be positive, we write in a positive number."

    {
        "text": "If it's going to be negative, we write in a negative number."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we just leave it alone."

        "text": "And the real, so here's, let me carry out an example."

        "text": "I'll carry out the example on this blackboard up here of the sine function."

        "text": "We're going to try the first hump and the one that goes underneath there."

        "text": "Of sin x dx."

        "text": "With the difference."
    },

        "text": "Now, when we carry out that difference, what we get here is minus cos 2pi minus minus cos 0."

        "text": "Because we flip the signs when we flip the order of a and b."

        "text": "So this one, it's essential that the lower limit be smaller than the upper limit."
    },

        "text": "So the answer is b."

        "text": "Or you can do it by antiderivatives, but it's b."
