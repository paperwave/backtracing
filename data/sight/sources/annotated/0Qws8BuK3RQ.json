    },
    {
        "text": "Well, we're going to fail on this example, because if the distance here is 1, the distance here is 1, then by the triangle inequality, the distance from x1 to x3 could not be more than 2."

    },
    {

        "text": "So anyway, that's a Greek myth for 18.065."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the whole idea of the Procrustes problem is to make something fit something else."

    },
    {
        "text": "But that's not the case."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're looking for the best possible."

    },
    {
        "text": "So Frobenius, we're into the Frobenius norm."

        "text": "Matrix, this is a very convenient norm in data science to measure the size of a matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we have several possible formulas for it."
    },

        "text": "So let me call the matrix A."
    },

        "text": "And the Frobenius norm squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so what's one expression in terms of the entries of the matrix, the numbers Aij in the matrix?"
    },
    {
        "text": "The Frobenius norm just treats it like a long vector."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's A11 squared plus A12 squared, all the way along the first plus second row."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "OK."
    },
    {
        "text": "But that's an awkward expression to write down."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what other ways do we have to find the Frobenius norm of a matrix?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's see."
    },
    {
        "text": "I can look at this as A transpose A."

        "text": "Is that right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "A transpose A."
    },

    },
    {
        "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
        "text": "I would get all that."
    },
    {
        "text": "I would get all these by taking the matrix A transpose times A."

        "text": "Sorry, I'm not."

    {
        "text": "I've lost my thread of talk here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here's."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, and then I take the trace, of course."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that first row, first column of A times that one will give me the one set of squares."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then that one times the other one, the next one, will give me the next set of squares."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is going to, if I look at the trace."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I just want to look at the diagonal here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's the trace."
    },
    {
        "text": "Remember, the trace of a matrix M is the sum down the diagonal, M11, M22, down to MNN."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's the diagonal sum."
    },
    {
        "text": "And everybody with me here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So that term on the diagonal of A transpose A gives me all of that."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or maybe I should be doing AA transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the point is, it doesn't matter."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or the trace of AA transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "Those would both give the correct Frobenius norm squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "So traces are going to come into this little problem."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, there's another formula for the Frobenius norm, even shorter, well, certainly shorter than this one, involving a sum of squares."
    },
    {
        "text": "And what's that one?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What's the other way to get this same answer?"
    },
    {
        "text": "If I look at the SVD, look at singular values, I think that this is also equal to sigma 1, the sum square of all the singular values."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's three nice expressions for the Frobenius norm."
    },
    {
        "text": "The nice ones involve A transpose A or AA transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "And of course, that connects to the singular values."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because what's the connection between singular values and these guys, A transpose A or AA transpose?"
    },
    {
        "text": "The singular values are the, or the singular values squared, are the eigenvalues of A transpose A."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then when I add up the trace, I'm adding up the eigenvalues."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that gives me the Frobenius norm squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that tells us something important, which we can see in different ways."
    },
    {
        "text": "So to solve this problem, we're going to need various facts."
    },
    {
        "text": "Like the QA in the Frobenius norm is the same as A in the Frobenius norm."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why is that?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Why?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So here I'm multiplying every column by the matrix Q."
    },
    {
        "text": "What happens to the length of the column when I multiply it by Q?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Doesn't change."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I could add up the lengths of the columns all squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here I wrote it in terms of rows, but I could have reordered that and got it in terms of columns."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's because the length of Q times any vector squared is the same as the vector squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "And take these to be the columns of A."
    },
    {
        "text": "So for column by column, the multiplication by Q doesn't change the length."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then when I add up all the columns squared, I get the Frobenius norm squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "And another way to say it, let's make the connection between this fact that Q didn't change the Frobenius norm and this fact that the Frobenius norm is expressed in terms of the sigmas."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what does Q do to the sigmas?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I want to see in another way the answer to why."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I have a matrix A with singular values, I multiply by Q, what happens to the singular values?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Don't change."
    },
    {
        "text": "Don't change."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the key point about singular values."
    },
    {
        "text": "If I multiply, so A has an SVD U sigma V transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "And QA will have the SVD QU sigma V transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "So all I've changed when I multiply by Q, all I changed was the first factor, the first orthogonal factor in the SVD."
    },
    {
        "text": "I didn't change the sigmas."
    },
    {
        "text": "They're still sitting there."
    },
    {
        "text": "And of course, I could do also Q on the other side."
    },
    {
        "text": "Different Q, same Q or a different Q on the other side would show up here."
    },
    {
        "text": "And would not change the sigmas, and therefore would not change the Frobenius norm."
    },
    {
        "text": "So these are important properties of this Frobenius norm."
    },
    {
        "text": "It looks messy to write down in that form, but it's much nicer in these forms and in that form."
    },
    {
        "text": "So now if I can just, then we saw that it involves traces."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let me make a few observations about traces."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'll just, we want to be able to play with traces, and that's something we really haven't done."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's a fact, that the trace of A transpose B is equal to the trace of B transpose A."
    },
    {
        "text": "Of course, if B is A, it's clear."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it's equal to the trace of B A transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you can do little changes in your matrix without changing the trace."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's see why one of these is true."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why is that first statement true?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Huh."
    },

        "text": "Huh."
    },
    {
        "text": "How is that matrix related to this matrix?"
    },

    },

        "text": "I have matrices Y and X."
    },

        "text": "And the idea is that I take its, I look at Y transpose X, so that'll be all the dot products of one set of vectors with the other set of vectors."

    },

        "text": "Of course, if Y was the same as X, if it was an orthogonal basis, you'd have the identity."
    },

        "text": "No questions."
    },
    {
        "text": "But generally, it has an SVD."

        "text": "And we're looking for a orthogonal matrix."

        "text": "So the best Q is, da-da-da-da, I mean, it's the right time for expressions of amazement."
    },
    {
        "text": "It is UV transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that gives us the answer."

        "text": "And meanwhile, to ask a whole lot of people, everybody I can find, about that important question is, does deep learning usually work?"
    },

        "text": "What can you do to make sure it works or give yourself a better chance to have it work?"
