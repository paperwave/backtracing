        "text": "That's, that's the basic fact."
    },
    {
        "text": "That, that the standard basis which gives the value of every pixel makes no use of the fact that we're getting a whole lot of pixels whose gray levels, the neighboring pixels tend to have the same gray level as the, as their, as their neighbors."

    },
    {
        "text": "Let me just say again."

        "text": "Of course, our image won't be solid, it'll have a mix of, of, solid and, and signal."
    },

        "text": "So that one vector, but that, having that one vector in the basis is, is, is going to save us a whole lot."

        "text": "Now the question is, what other vectors should be in the basis?"
    },
    {
        "text": "The, the extreme vector in the basis might be a vector of one minus one, one minus one, one minus one."
    },

        "text": "That would be a vector that shows, I mean, that's like a checkerboard vector, right?"
    },

        "text": "But much more common would be maybe to have half the image, darker and the other half lighter."

        "text": "And it's a billion dollar decision what we choose."

        "text": "So, what do I mean by this eight by eight?"

        "text": "And we, sort of, this is too much to deal with at once."
    },

        "text": "And then, now, let's see, I was going to write down Fourier, so you remember Fourier is, is this vector of all ones, and then, the vector, oh, well, actually, I gave a lecture earlier about the Fourier matrix, these, this matrix whose columns are powers of a, of a, complex number w. I, I won't repeat that, because I'm not, I don't want to go into the details of the Fourier basis."

        "text": "Well, one thing we could do is just throw away the small coefficients."
