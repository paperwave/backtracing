        "text": "And in a way, generalized linear models, as the word says, are just a generalization of linear models."
    },
    {
        "text": "And they're actually extremely useful."
    },
    {
        "text": "They're often forgotten about, and people just jump onto machine learning and sophisticated techniques."
    },
    {
        "text": "But those things do the job quite well."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's see in what sense they are a generalization of the linear model."
    },
    {
        "text": "So remember, the linear model looked like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "We said that y was equal to x transpose beta plus epsilon."
    },
    {
        "text": "That was our linear regression model."
    },
    {
        "text": "And another way to say this is that if I, let's assume that those were, say, Gaussian with mean 0 and identity covariance matrix, then another way to say this is that the conditional distribution of y given x is a Gaussian with mean x transpose beta and variance, well, we had a sigma square, which I will forget as usual, x transpose beta and then sigma square."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here, we just assumed that, so what is regression?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's just saying I'm trying to explain y as a function of x given x. I'm assuming a distribution for the y."
    },

        "text": "And this x is just going to be here to help me model what the mean of this Gaussian is."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, I could have something crazy."
    },
    {
        "text": "I could have something that looks like y given x is n0 x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then this guy could be some other thing, which looks like, I don't know, some x transpose gamma squared times, I don't know, x x transpose plus identity, some crazy thing that depends on x here."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we deliberately assume that all the thing that depends on x shows up in the mean."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so what I have here is that y given x is a Gaussian with a mean that depends on x and covariance matrix sigma square identity."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, the linear model assumed a very specific form for the mean."
    },
    {
        "text": "It said, I want the mean to be equal to x transpose beta, which, remember, was the sum from, say, j equals 1 to p of beta j xj, where the xj's are the coordinates of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I could do something also more complicated."
    },
    {
        "text": "I could have something that looks like, instead, replace this by, I don't know, sum of beta j log of x to the j divided by x to the j squared, or something like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "I could do this as well."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's two things that we've assumed."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first one is that when I look at the conditional distribution of y given x, x affects only the mean."
    },
    {
        "text": "I also assumed that it was Gaussian, and that it affects only the mean."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the mean is affected in a very specific way, which is linear in x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is essentially the things we're going to try to relax."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the first thing that we assume, the fact that y was Gaussian and had only its mean that depended on x, is what's called the random component."
    },
    {
        "text": "It just says that the response variables sort of make sense to assume that they're Gaussian."
    },
    {
        "text": "And everything was essentially captured."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's this property of Gaussians that if you tell me if the variance is known, all you need to tell me to understand exactly what the distribution of a Gaussian is, all you need to tell me is its expected value."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's this mu of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the second thing is that we had this link that says, well, I need to find a way to use my x's to explain this mu."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the link was exactly mu of x was equal to x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, we are talking about generalized linear models."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this part here, where mu of x is of the form, the way I want my beta, my x, to show up is linear."
    },
    {
        "text": "This will never be questioned."
    },
    {
        "text": "In principle, I could add a third point, which is just question this part, the fact that mu of x is x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "I could have some more complicated nonlinear function of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I will never do that, because we're talking about generalized linear model."
    },
    {
        "text": "The only thing with generalized are the random component, the conditional distribution of y given x, and the link that just says, well, once you actually tell me that the only thing I need to figure out is the mean, I'm just going to slap it exactly this x transpose beta thing without any transformation of x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So those are the two things."
    },
    {
        "text": "It will become clearer what I mean."
    },
    {
        "text": "This sounds like a tautology, but let's just see how we could extend that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what we're going to do in generalized linear models, so when I talk about GLMs, the first thing I'm going to do with my x is turn it into some x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's just the L part."

    {
        "text": "This I'm not going to be able to change."

        "text": "That's the way it works."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm not going to do anything nonlinear."
    },
    {
        "text": "But the two things I'm going to change is this random component, which is that y, which used to be some Gaussian with mean mu of x variance sigma squared."

    },
    {
        "text": "This is going to become y given x follows some distribution."

        "text": "And I'm not going to allow any distribution."

        "text": "All right, so we'll see that."
    },
    {
        "text": "What can that be?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, yeah, that's actually my."

        "text": "I'm sorry?"

        "text": "OK, so hopefully this is muted."
    },
    {
        "text": "So essentially, this is going to be a family of distributions."
    },
    {
        "text": "And what makes them exponential typically is that there's an exponential that shows up in the definition of the density."
    },
    {
        "text": "We'll see that the Gaussian belongs to the exponential family."
    },
    {
        "text": "But there are slightly less expected ones, because there's this crazy thing that a to the x is exponential x log a, which makes the exponential show up without being there."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if there's an exponential of some power, it's going to show up."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it's more than that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we'll actually come to this particular family of distribution."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why this particular family?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Because in a way, everything we've done for the linear model with Gaussian is going to extend fairly naturally to this family."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it actually also, because it encompasses pretty much everything, all the distributions we've discussed before."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so the second thing that I want to question, so before we just said, well, mu of x was directly equal to this thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "Mu of x was directly x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I knew I was going to have an x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I said, well, I could do something with this x transpose beta before I used it to explain the expected value."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I'm actually taking it like that."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here we're going to say, let's extend this to some function is equal to this thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, admittedly, this is not the most natural way to think about it."
    },
    {
        "text": "What you would probably feel more comfortable doing is write something like mu of x is a function."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's call it f of x transpose beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "But here I just decide to call f g inverse."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, that's just my g inverse, yes."
    },
    {
        "text": "Is this different than just transforming the x's?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, what transformation do you want to put on your x's?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Like, is this equivalent to just applying some function to each individual x component and then multiplying that beta to get the mean?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, no, certainly not, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, if I force you to work with x1 plus x2, you cannot work with any function of x1 plus any function of x2, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So yeah, this is different."
    },
    {
        "text": "So yeah, the transformation would be just the simple part of your linear regression problem, where you would take your x's, transform them, and then just apply another linear regression."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is genuinely new."
    },
    {
        "text": "Any other question?"
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so this function g, and the reason why I sort of have to stick to this slightly less natural way of defining it is because that's g that gets a name, not g inverse that gets a name."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the name of g is the link function."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I want to give you a generalized linear model, I need to give you two ingredients."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first one is the random component, which is the distribution of y given x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it can be anything in what's called the exponential family of distributions."
    },
    {
        "text": "So for example, I could say y given x is Gaussian with mean ux sigma squared identity."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I could also tell you y given x is gamma with shape parameter equal to alpha of x. I could do some weird things like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the second thing is I need to give you a link function."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the link function is going to become very clear how you pick a link function."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the only reason that you actually pick a link function is because of compatibility."
    },
    {
        "text": "This mu of x, I call it mu because mu of x is always the conditional expectation of y given x, always, which means that let's think of y as being a Bernoulli random variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "Where does mu of x live?"
    },
    {
        "text": "AUDIENCE 2."
    },
    {
        "text": "0, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "0, 1, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the expectation of a Bernoulli."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's just the probability that my coin flip gives me 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's a number between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "But this guy right here, if my x's are anything, think of any body measurements, plus I take linear combinations with arbitrarily large coefficients, this thing can be any real number."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the link function, what it's effectively going to do is make those two things compatible."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's going to take my number, which, for example, is constrained to be between 0 and 1, and map it into the entire real line."
    },
    {
        "text": "If I have mu, which is forced to be positive, for example, in an exponential distribution, the mean is positive, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the, say, I don't know, inter-arrival time for Poisson process."
    },
    {
        "text": "This thing is known to be positive for an exponential."
    },
    {
        "text": "I need to map something that's exponential to the entire real line."
    },
    {
        "text": "I need a function that takes something positive and then tickets everyone."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we'll see, by the end of this chapter, you will have 100 ways of doing this."
    },
    {
        "text": "But there are some more traditional ones than other."
    },
    {
        "text": "So before we go any further, I gave you this example of a Bernoulli random variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's see a few examples that actually fit there."
    },
    {
        "text": "Yes?"
    },
    {
        "text": "AUDIENCE 1 Will it come up later if we already know why the mean distribution is increasing entirely?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Why can't we do it?"
    },
    {
        "text": "PHILIPPE RIGOLLET Well, actually, this will not come up later."
    },
    {
        "text": "It should be very clear from here."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because if I actually have a model, I just want it to be plausible, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, what happens if I suddenly decide that my, so this is what's going to happen."
    },
    {
        "text": "You're going to have only data to fit this model."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's say you actually forget about this thing here."
    },
    {
        "text": "You can always do this, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "You can always say, I'm going to pretend my y's just happen to be the realizations of, say, Gaussians that happen to be 0 or 1 only."
    },
    {
        "text": "You can always stuff that in some linear model, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "You will have some least squares estimator for beta."
    },
    {
        "text": "But what's going to happen, and it's going to be fine."
    },
    {
        "text": "For all the points that you see, it will definitely put some number that's actually between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is what your picture is going to look like."
    },
    {
        "text": "You're going to have a bunch of values for x."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is your y."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so these are the values of x that you will get."
    },
    {
        "text": "And for y, you will see either 0 or 1, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what your Bernoulli data set would look like with a one-dimensional x."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, if you do least squares on this, you will find this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And for this guy, this line certainly takes values between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "But let's say now you get an x here."
    },
    {
        "text": "You're going to actually start pretending the probability that it spits out one conditionally in x is like 1.2, and that's going to be weird."
    },

        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Any other questions?"
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so let's start with some examples."
    },
    {
        "text": "Right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, you got so used to them throughout this course."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the first one is all these things are taken."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's a few books on generalizing your models, generalize additive models, and there's tons of applications that you can see."
    },
    {
        "text": "Those are extremely versatile."
    },
    {
        "text": "And as soon as you want to do modeling to explain some y given x, you sort of need to do that if you want to go beyond linear models."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this was the disease occurring rate."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you have a disease epidemic, and you want to basically model the expected number of new cases given at a certain time."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So you have time that progresses for each of your reservation."

        "text": "Each of your relation is a timestamp, say, I don't know, 20th day."
    },
    {
        "text": "And your response is the number of new cases."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you're going to actually put your model directly on mu, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "When I looked at this, everything here was on mu itself, on the expected, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Mu of x is always the expected, the conditional expectation of y given x."
    },
    {
        "text": "Right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So all I need to model is this expected value."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this mu, I'm going to actually say, so I look at some parameters, and it says, well, it increases exponentially."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I want to have some sort of exponential trend."
    },
    {
        "text": "I can parameterize that in several ways."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the two parameters I want to slap in is some sort of gamma, which is just the coefficient."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then there's some rate delta that's in the exponential."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I tell you it's exponential, that's a nice family of functions you might want to think about."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so here, mu of x, if I want to keep the notation x, is gamma exponential delta x, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Except that here, my x are t1, t2, t3, et cetera."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And I want to find what the parameters gamma and delta are because I want to be able to maybe compare different epidemics and see if they have the same parameter or maybe just do some prediction based on the data that I have to extrapolate in the future."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So here, clearly, mu of x is not of the form x transpose beta."
    },

        "text": "And we used the fact that something that looked like this, the log likelihood is log of f theta."
    },
    {
        "text": "And when I take the derivative of this guy with respect to theta, then I have something that looks like the derivative divided by f theta."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if I start taking the integral against f theta of this thing, so the expectation of this thing, those things would cancel."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then I had just the integral of a derivative, which I would make a leap of faith and say that it's actually the derivative of the integral."
    },
    {
        "text": "But this was equal to 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this derivative was actually equal to 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so that's how you got that the expectation of the derivative of the log likelihood is equal to 0."
    },

    },

    },
    {
        "text": "And missing a parenthesis over there."
    },
    {
        "text": "So when you write the log likelihood, it's just log of an exponential."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's actually pretty nice."
    },
    {
        "text": "Just like the least squares came naturally, the least squares criterion came naturally when we took the log likelihood of the Gaussians."
    },

    {
        "text": "When I take the log of the density, the exponential is going to go away."

    {
        "text": "And then I'm going to use this formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "But this formula is going to actually give me an equation directly."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, that's where it was."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the one that's missing it there."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the expectation minus this thing is going to be equal to 0, which tells me that the expectation is just the derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's still a function of theta, but it's just the derivative of b."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the variance is just going to be the second derivative of b."
    },
    {
        "text": "But remember, this was some sort of a scaling."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's called the dispersion parameter."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I had a Gaussian, and the variance of the Gaussian did not depend on the sigma square, which I stuffed in this phi, that would be certainly weird."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it cannot depend only on mu."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so for the Gaussian, this is definitely going to be equal to 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is just going to be equal to my variance."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is just by taking the second derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "So basically, the take-home message is that this function b captures, by taking one derivative of the expectation and by taking two derivatives, captures the variance."
    },
    {
        "text": "Another thing that's actually cool, and we'll come back to this and I want you to think about, is if this second derivative is the variance, what can I say about this thing?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What do I know about a variance?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yeah, it's positive."
    },

        "text": "So I know that this is positive."

        "text": "Positive?"

        "text": "A function that has positive second derivative is convex."
