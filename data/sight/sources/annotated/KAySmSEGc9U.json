        "text": "And we talked about non-determinism."

        "text": "So we had non-deterministic finite automata and deterministic finite automata."

        "text": "We looked at the closure properties over the regular operations, union, concatenation, and star, and showed that the regular languages, really the class of regular languages, is closed under those regular operations."

    },
    {
        "text": "But along the way, introducing these models of finite automata and context-free languages is interesting and helpful because many of those, a number of those models turn out to be useful in a number of applications, whether it's from linguistics to programming languages."

        "text": "So in other words, we have a way of, we gave a way of converting regular expressions to finite automata, as kind of shown in this diagram."
    },

        "text": "Oh, and just a reminder in case you're just getting yourself your memory to work, maybe it'll help you just to remember that we actually did an example of that conversion."

        "text": "So we're going to invert that and go backwards the other way."

    },
    {
        "text": "So basically, we're going to give a conversion from finite automata to regular expressions."
    },
    {
        "text": "But before we do that, we're going to have to introduce a new concept."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're not going to be able to dive right into that conversion."
    },
    {
        "text": "We're going to have to introduce a new model first, which is going to facilitate that conversion."
    },

        "text": "And that new model is called, it's yet another kind of finite automaton, called a generalized nondeterministic finite automaton, or a generalized NFA, or just simply a GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is yet another variant of the finite automaton model."
    },
    {
        "text": "And conceptually, it's very simple."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's similar to the NFAs."

        "text": "I'll give you, here's a picture of a GNFA named G, G1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Very similar to the NFAs."
    },
    {
        "text": "But if you look at it for a second, you'll see that the transitions have more complicated labels."
    },
    {
        "text": "For the NFAs, we're only allowing just single symbols or the empty string to appear on the labels."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now I'm actually allowing you to put full regular expressions on the labels for the automaton."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, we have to understand how a GNFA processes its input."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the way it works is not complicated to understand."
    },
    {
        "text": "When you're getting an input string, feeling when a GNFA is processing an input string, it starts at the start state, just like you would imagine."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now, to go along a transition, instead of reading just a single symbol or the empty string, as in the case for the nondeterministic machine, it actually gets to read a whole string at one step, kind of at one byte."
    },
    {
        "text": "It can read an entire string and go along that transition arrow, provided that chunk of the input that it read is in the regular expression that that transition has as its label."
    },
    {
        "text": "So for example, you can go from Q1 to Q2 in one step in this GNFA by reading AABB off the input."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it reads all of those four symbols all at once, just swoops them up, and then moves from Q1 to Q2 in one step."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then when it's in Q2, it can read AAB and move to Q3."
    },
    {
        "text": "And Q3 happens, there's nowhere to go."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is going to be a nondeterministic machine."
    },
    {
        "text": "There might be several different ways of processing the input."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if any one of them gets to an accepting state at the end of the input, we say the GNFA accepts."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's similar to nondeterministic to NFAs in the way the acceptance criterion works."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you could do an example, but hopefully, the concept of how this works is reasonably, you can at least buy it, that it processes the input in chunks at a time."
    },
    {
        "text": "And those chunks have to be described by the regular expressions on the transition arrows as it moves along those transitions."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what we're going to do now is to convert not DFAs to regular expressions."
    },
    {
        "text": "We're going to convert GNFAs to regular expression."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's even harder because GNFAs allow you to do all sorts of other things besides just ordinary DFAs."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's a harder job."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why am I making my life harder?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, you'll see in a minute that it's going to actually turn out to be helpful to be working with a more powerful model in the way this construction is going to work."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, before I dive in and do the construction from GNFAs to regular expressions, I'm going to make a simplifying assumption about the GNFAs."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to put them in a special form that's going to make it easier to do the conversion."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that simpler form is, first of all, I'm going to assume the GNFA has just a single accepting state."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that accepting state is not allowed to be the start state."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it has to have just a single accepting state."
    },
    {
        "text": "I've already violated that convenient assumption in this GNFA because I have here two accepting states."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's not what I want."
    },
    {
        "text": "I want to have just one."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, the thing is, it's easy to obtain just one, just to modify the machine so that I have just one by adding a new accepting state, which is branched to from the former accepting states by empty transition."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I can always jump from Q2 to Q4 at any time without even reading any input, just going along this empty transition."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then I declassify the former accepting states as accepting."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now I have here just a single accepting state."
    },
    {
        "text": "And because it's going to be a new state that I added, it won't be the start state."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I have accomplished that one aspect of my assumption about the form of the GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "But there's another thing that I want to do too."
    },
    {
        "text": "I want to assume, as you will see, which is going to be convenient in my construction, that we will have transition arrows going from every state to every other state."
    },
    {
        "text": "In fact, I want transition arrows going from every state, even back to themselves."
    },
    {
        "text": "I want there to be all possible transition arrows should be present, with two exceptions."
    },
    {
        "text": "For the start state, there should be only transition arrows exiting the start state."
    },
    {
        "text": "And for the accepting state, there's just one now, there should be only transition arrows coming in to the start state."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's kind of what you would imagine as being reasonable."
    },
    {
        "text": "For the other states which are not accepting or starting, there should be transition arrows leaving and coming from everywhere else."
    },
    {
        "text": "But for the start states, just leaving, and for the accept state, just coming in."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you can easily modify the machine to achieve that."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's just see how to do that in one example."
    },
    {
        "text": "So notice that from Q3 to Q2, there is no transition right now."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's not good."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's not what I want."
    },
    {
        "text": "I want there to be a transition from Q3 to Q2."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I'll just add that transition in."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I'm going to label it with the empty language regular expression."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that means, yeah, the transition is there, but you never can take it."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it doesn't change the language that the machine is going to be recognizing, but it fulfills my assumption, my convenient assumption, that we have all of these transition arrows being present in the machine."
    },
    {
        "text": "So anyway, I hope you will buy it."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not going to be, if you don't quite get this, don't worry."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not totally critical that you're following all of these little adjustments and modifications to the GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it will be helpful to understand what GNFA themselves, how they work."
    },
    {
        "text": "So as I mentioned, we can easily modify GNFA to have the special form that we're assuming here."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so now we're going to jump in and start doing the conversion."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're going to have a lemma, which is like a theorem that really is just a local interest here."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not a general interest theorem."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's going to be relevant just to GNFA, which are really just defined to help us do this conversion."
    },
    {
        "text": "They really don't have any other independent value."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I want to show that every GNFA has an equivalent regular expression R. That's really my goal."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the way we're going to prove that is by induction."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's going to be by induction on the number of states of the GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, you really should be familiar with induction as one of the expectations for being in this course."
    },
    {
        "text": "But in case you're a little shaky on it, don't worry."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to unpack it as a procedure."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's really just recursion."
    },
    {
        "text": "And a proof that uses induction is really just a proof that calls itself."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's just a proof that it's a recursive proof."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's all it is."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if you're comfortable with recursion, you'll be comfortable with induction."
    },
    {
        "text": "But anyway, I'm going to describe this as a procedure."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if you're a little shaky on induction, don't worry."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the basis is, so first, I'm going to handle the case where the GNFA has just two states."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, remember, I'm assuming now my GNFAs are in the special form."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you can't even have a GNFA with one state because it has to have a start state, and it has to have an accept state, and they have to not be the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the smallest possible GNFA to worry about is a two-state GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, if we happen to have a two-state GNFA, it turns out to be very easy to find the equivalent regular expression."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Because that two-state GNFA can only look like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "It can have a start state, can have an accept state, and it can only have a transition going from the start to the accept because no other transitions are allowed."
    },
    {
        "text": "It only has outgoing from the start, only incoming to the accept."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so there's only one transition, and it has a label with a regular expression r. So what do you think the equivalent regular expression is for this GNFA?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's just simply the one that's labeling that transition because that tells us when I can go from the start to the accept."
    },
    {
        "text": "And there's nothing else the machine can do."
    },
    {
        "text": "It just makes one step, which is to accept its input if it's described by that regular expression."
    },
    {
        "text": "So therefore, the equivalent regular expression that we're looking for is simply label on that single transition."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so two-state GNFAs are easy."
    },
    {
        "text": "But what happens if you have more states?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Then you're going to actually have to do some work."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we call that the induction step."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's when we have more than two states."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the way the induction works is we're going to assume we already know how to do it for k minus 1 states."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we're going to use that knowledge to show how to do it for k states."
    },
    {
        "text": "So in other words, we already know how to do it for two states."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to use that fact to show how to do it for three states, and then use the fact that I can do it for three states to show how to do it for four states, and so on and so on."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And the idea for how to do that is actually pretty easy to grasp."
    },
    {
        "text": "What we're going to do is if we have a k-state GNFA that we want to convert, we're going to change that k-state GNFA to a k minus 1-state GNFA, and then use our assumption that we already know how to do the k minus 1-state GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So in terms of a picture, I'm going to take a k-state to prove that I can always convert k-state GNFAs to regular expressions."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to show how to convert the k-state one into an equivalent k minus 1-state GNFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then if you just like to think of it this procedurally, the k minus 1 gets converted to a k minus 2, gets converted to a k minus 3, and so on and so on, until I get down to 2, which then I know how to do directly."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So the whole name of the game here is figuring out how to convert a GNFA that has k states into another one that has one fewer state that does the same language."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so you have to hold that in your head."
    },
    {
        "text": "I mean, I wish I had more blackboard space here, but it's very limited here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you have to remember what we're going to be doing on the next slide, because that's going to finish the job for us."
    },
    {
        "text": "As long as I can show in general how to convert a k-state GNFA to a GNFA that has one fewer state, but it still does the same language, I'm good."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because then I can keep iterating that until I get down to 2."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right, so this is the guts of the argument."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I have my k-state machine."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's my start state."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's my accept state."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's my k minus 1 state, that machine that I'm going to be building for you."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's actually going to look almost exactly the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm just going to remove one state from the bigger machine."
    },
    {

        "text": "I'm not sure."

        "text": "But whatever it is, you need to think a little bit about what's going on here, because the reason why we are done is because DFAs are a kind of GNFAs."

        "text": "They have a very simple kind of regular expression on each transition."
    },

        "text": "They just have the regular expression, which is just a single symbol."

        "text": "So all DFAs are automatically GNFAs."

        "text": "So if I can convert GNFAs, I can certainly convert DFAs, because GNFAs include the DFAs."

        "text": "I'm done."

        "text": "It really was number C was the correct answer."

    },
    {
        "text": "So participation is good enough."

        "text": "But I do think you need to think about what's going on and making sure that you're following along."

        "text": "We have to make them to the special type."

        "text": "But we already showed how to make GNFAs into the special type."

        "text": "But that applies to GNFAs in general."

        "text": "So it's nothing special about DFAs there."

        "text": "And hopefully, you'll be following going forward."

        "text": "Anyway, let us look now at proving non-regularity."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're finished with our goal of showing that regular languages can either come from DFAs or from regular expressions."
    },
    {
        "text": "Those are the same in terms of, from the perspective of our course, they're interchangeable."
    },

        "text": "So now, as we mentioned, there are going to be some languages which are not regular, which can't be done by DFAs."

    {
        "text": "They're actually, DFAs are actually pretty weak as a computational model."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so there's all sorts of very simple things that they cannot do."
    },
    {
        "text": "There are some fairly complicated things that they can do, surprisingly enough."
    },
    {
        "text": "But anyway, there are some simple things they can't do."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so we have to develop a method for showing that a language is not regular."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's going to be useful for your homework and, in general, for just understanding the power of DFAs."
    },
    {
        "text": "So how do we show a language is not regular?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So remember, if you want to show a language is regular, basically, what you need to do is give a DFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or you can use the closure properties."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's another way of showing a language is regular."
    },
    {
        "text": "But underneath that, it's basically constructing DFAs."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right."
    },
    {
        "text": "To show a language is not regular, you have to give a proof."
    },

        "text": "Generally, not a construction."
    },

        "text": "It's a proof that there is no DFA or that it's just going to be impossible to make a DFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we have to develop a method."
    },
    {
        "text": "What is that proof method?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, there is a tempting, I've taught this course many times, and there's a kind of a tempting approach that many people have."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not only going to apply for finite automata, but for other things too."
    },
    {
        "text": "And believe me, it's not only people in this class."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's for people out there who are trying to think about computation in general, which is to say, well, I have some language of trying to figure out if it's regular or not."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so I thought really hard how to make a DFA, and I couldn't find one."
    },
    {
        "text": "Therefore, it's not regular."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's not a proof."
    },
    {
        "text": "Just because you couldn't find a DFA doesn't mean there is no DFA."
    },
    {
        "text": "You need to prove that the language is not regular using some method."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm going to give you an example where that kind of approach can lead you wrong."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that is, I'll give two examples of languages where you might try to prove they're regular or not, and you could be in trouble if you just follow that kind of informal approach."

        "text": "B is the language of all strings that have an equal number of 0's and 1's."
    },

        "text": "So you want to know, if I have 1,000 0's, I need to have 1,000 1's."
    },
    {
        "text": "So basically, the way you test that, you'd have to count up the number of 0's, count up the number of 1's, and see if those two counts are the same."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's going to be really tough to make a DFA do, because how are you going to remember that really big number of 0's that the DFA might have 50 states, but you might need to count up to 100 or a million to figure out, to count up how many 0's you've seen."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it seems really hard to be able to do that kind of a count when you only have 50 states."
    },

        "text": "So whatever number of states you have, it seems hard to count when you have a finite automaton."
    },

        "text": "So the intuition is, it's not regular, because a finite automaton can't count, which, in this case, you can convert that intuition into a real proof."

        "text": "I would say it's not a real proof yet, but it can be made into a real proof."
    },
    {
        "text": "But compare that case with another language, which I'll call C, which instead of looking at its input to see whether it has an equal number of 0's and 1's, I'm going to look at the input and look at the substrings of 0 1's and 1 0's, those two substrings, and count the number of occurrences of 0 1 as a substring and the number of occurrences of 1 0 as a substring."

        "text": "OK?"
    },

        "text": "So it has to be accepted by M. But the important thing is that it repeats a state."

        "text": "If you take the B, which is the equal numbers of 0's and 1's, and you intersect it with 0 star 1 star, that's going to be a regular language if B was regular using closure under intersection."
    },
    {
        "text": "But this language B intersects 0 star 1 star is the language of equal numbers of 0's and 1's where the 0's come first."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's the language D that we showed two slides back that we already know can't be regular."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that intersection cannot be regular, and so it violates the closure property."
    },
    {
        "text": "And again, we get a contradiction."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's a different way of sometimes making a shortcut to prove a language is not regular."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we have in our last 10 minutes or so, we're going to shift gears totally in an entirely different way and consider a new model of computation, which is more powerful, that can actually do things that we can't do with finite automata."
    },
    {
        "text": "And these are called context-free grammars."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is really just a kind of an introduction."
    },
    {
        "text": "We're going to spend all of next lecture looking at context-free grammars."
    },
    {
        "text": "And they're associated languages."
    },
    {
        "text": "But let's just do kind of get a preview."
    },
    {
        "text": "So a context-free grammar looks like this."
    },
    {
        "text": "You have a bunch of these what we call substitution rules or rules sometimes, which just look like a symbol, arrow, a string of symbols."
    },
    {
        "text": "All right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what a context-free grammar looks like at a high level."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let's define some terms."
    },
    {
        "text": "So a rule, as I just described, is going to be a symbol, which we're going to call a variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's going to have an arrow to a string of possibly other variables and symbols called terminals."
    },
    {
        "text": "So a variable is a symbol that appears on the left-hand side of a rule."
    },
    {
        "text": "Anything that appears on the left-hand side is going to be considered to be a variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "So s and r are both variables."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, other symbols that appear in the grammar, which don't appear in the left-hand side, those are going to be called terminals."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here, 0 and 1 are terminals."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, you may think that empty string should also be a terminal, but that's not a symbol."
    },
    {
        "text": "Empty string is a string."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's just a string of length 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm not considering empty string to be a terminal."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then there's going to be a special variable, which is going to be considered the starting variable, just like we had a starting state."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's typically going to be written as the top left symbol."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this symbol s here is going to be the starting symbol."
    },
    {
        "text": "And grammars can be used to define languages and to gen, well, to generate strings and to define languages."
    },
    {
        "text": "So first of all, let's see how a grammar using this as an illustration can generate strings."
    },
    {
        "text": "Actually, just to emphasize this terminology here, in this particular example, we had three rules."
    },
    {
        "text": "The two variables were r and s. The two terminals were 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the start variable was this top left-hand symbol, as I mentioned, the s. So grammars generate strings."
    },
    {
        "text": "The way they do is you follow a certain procedure, which is really pretty simple."
    },
    {
        "text": "You write down, first of all, the start variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'll do an example in a second."
    },
    {
        "text": "You write down the start variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then you take a look at what you've written down."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if it has any variables in it, you can apply one of the corresponding right-hand sides of a rule as a substitution for that variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so, for example, if you have an s in the thing you've written down, you can substitute for that s a 0, s, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Or you can substitute for that s an r. Or if you have an r, you can substitute for that s an empty string."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you're just going to keep on doing that substitutions over and over again until there are no variables left."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's nothing left to substitute."
    },
    {
        "text": "Only terminals remain."
    },
    {
        "text": "At that point, you have generated a string in the language."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the language, then, is the collection of all generated strings."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, let's do an example."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's an example of G1 generating some string."
    },
    {
        "text": "So as I mentioned, first of all, you're going to write down the start variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'm just going to illustrate this in sort of two parallel tracks here."
    },
    {
        "text": "On the left side, I'm going to show you the tree of substitutions."
    },
    {
        "text": "And on the right side, I'm going to show you the resulting string that you get by applying those substitutions."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So over here, I'm going to substitute for s the string 0, s1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So on the right-hand side, I just have 0, s1 because that's what I substituted for s. But you'll see it's going to look a little different in a second."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here, again, I still have a variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm going to substitute for s 0, s1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now I have the resulting string 0, 0, s1, 1 because I've substituted 0, s1 for the previous s. But the 0 and 1 stick around from before."
    },
    {
        "text": "They don't go anywhere."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I have at this point 0, 0, s1, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now I'm going to take a different choice."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to substitute for s. I could have gone either way."
    },
    {
        "text": "There's sort of something almost like nondeterminism here because you have a choice."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to substitute for s. Instead of 0, s1, I'm going to substitute r because that's also legitimate in terms of the rules."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so now I'm going to have 0, 0, r, 1, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now r, there's no choices here."
    },
    {
        "text": "r can only be substituted for by an empty string."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I get to r becomes just empty string."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in terms of the string generated, empty string doesn't add anything."
    },
    {
        "text": "It just really is nothing."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's a nothing."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I get the string 0, 0, 1, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is a string just of terminal symbols."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so that is a string in the language of the grammar G1."
    },
    {
        "text": "If you think about it, G1's language is that language that we saw before, which I think we called D. 0 to the k, 1 to the k for k greater than or equal to 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is an example of a language that a context-free grammar can do, but a finite automaton cannot do."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that is our little introduction to content."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oops, there's one more check-in here."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, yeah, so I'm asking you to actually look at, let me get myself out of this picture so you don't see me blocking things."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we will do one last check-in."
    },
    {
        "text": "Check-in, make sure you're staying around for the whole thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now there could be several of these strings that are in the language."
    },
    {
        "text": "You have to click them all."
    },
    {
        "text": "All the ones that you have found that are in the language of this grammar that can be generated by grammar G2, you have to click those."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'll give you a little bit more time on this one to see which ones G2 can generate."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'll give you a hint."
    },
    {
        "text": "There's more than one, but not all."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I see you're making some progress here."
    },
    {
        "text": "Interesting."
    },
    {
        "text": "So please, we're going to wrap this up very quickly."
    },
    {
        "text": "You can click, somebody's telling me you can unclick."
    },
    {
        "text": "Thank you, good to know."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so still things are coming in here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're running toward the end of the hour here."
    },
    {
        "text": "I don't want to go over."
    },

        "text": "So I'm going to end it in five seconds."
    },
    {
        "text": "Click away."
    },
    {
        "text": "And don't forget, we're not going to charge you if you get it wrong."
    },
    {
        "text": "Sharing results, I don't know why it has an orange one there because there are several correct answers here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's A, B, and D are correct."
    },
    {
        "text": "You can get any of those."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's really sort of two copies of the language we had before next to one another."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so the only thing you cannot get is 1, 0, 1, 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I encourage you to think about that."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I will come to our last side of today, which is just a quick review."
    },
    {
        "text": "I can put myself back."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we showed how to convert DFAs to regular expressions."
    },

        "text": "And the summary is that DFAs, NFAs, GNFAs even, and regular expressions are all equivalent in the class of languages they can describe."
    },

        "text": "The second thing we did was a method for proving languages not regular by using the pumping lemma or closure properties."
    },
    {
        "text": "And lastly, we introduced context-free grammars."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we're going to see more about those on Thursday."
    },
    {
        "text": "So with that, I think we're out of time."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'll thank you for the notes of appreciation."
