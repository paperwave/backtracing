        "text": "And two topics for today."
    },
    {
        "text": "One is to go back to Professor Sra's lecture."
    },
    {
        "text": "That was last Friday."
    },
    {
        "text": "And he promised a theorem and proof."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this morning, he sent it to me."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's the convergence."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's proving the convergence of stochastic gradient descent."
    },
    {
        "text": "And really, what's important, maybe, and useful is not so much the details of the proof, which I'm just learning, but the assumptions."
    },
    {
        "text": "You know, what's the logic here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What do you have to assume about the gradient and about the algorithm to get the answer?"
    },
    {
        "text": "But now, I actually look back at the video of his lecture."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it was excellent."
    },
    {
        "text": "And as I looked at it, there were a couple of things later in the lecture that I thought would make good projects."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I don't know if anybody is still open to what to do on a project."
    },
    {
        "text": "But here are my two ideas."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if you've already finished your project, well, get an A-plus by considering one of these."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you remember, and this will remind you of the lecture, which is a good thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "So do you remember that question one was whether in the stochastic part, after you've sampled one or some mini batch, but let's just say one of the loss functions coming from one sample, you remember the whole point is that if we do all zillion samples at every iteration, we're really, really slow."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the stochastic idea is to randomly pick one or a mini batch of the samples and just reduce their loss, just deal with the loss, say the square loss, or later we'll see cross-entropy loss."
    },
    {
        "text": "But whatever the cost is, just do a few or one."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then the question was, after you've done that one, do you put it back in the pot and every time you sample over the whole collection, but that's expensive, or do you just make a list of random list of random order of all the samples and go through them, which is then without replacement, which is sort of semi-illegal."
    },
    {
        "text": "That is, the logic in the randomization asks you to replace every time, but nobody does it."
    },
    {
        "text": "It costs a lot, probably not worth it."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the project would be, suppose you take 1,000, or say just 100, 100 random numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "Say you use MATLAB, just the command rand."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you get numbers whose average is 1 by 2 from rand."
    },
    {
        "text": "They're between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we know what the average is."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's compute it two ways."
    },
    {
        "text": "One is by not replacing, and that's the interesting one."
    },
    {
        "text": "So take 100 samples."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I guess we know that after we've got through the full 100, we're going to get exactly the right answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "But anyway, my question would be, how much difference do you see in the eventual approach?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So the law of large numbers, I guess, would tell us we get an average of 1 half for these numbers with uniform distribution between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "Should I be writing anything here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Maybe I should."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is project 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "So you pick numbers a, k, which is rand from rand, so uniformly on 0, 1, on 0, 0, 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then my question is, what about convergence to the average is 1 half?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And so this may be too simple an example, but could we see what happens for the convergence of the average as you either do replacements or don't do replacements?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And then, in fact, I would like to see a figure that looks like those in his lecture."
    },
    {
        "text": "He started it somewhere."
    },
    {
        "text": "Start."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then here's the finish."
    },
    {
        "text": "But you remember that stochastic gradient descent was kind of pretty effective at the beginning."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, the beginning, those might be 100 iterations each, one epoch, one run through the full number."
    },
    {
        "text": "But then when it got to here, got closer, it started oscillating."
    },
    {
        "text": "You remember he identified the region of confusion around the thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, my suggestion is just I think those videos should be accessible to you on, are they on Stellar?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'd love to see that behavior in some good examples of that behavior and some pictures to use."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that would be one idea."
    },
    {
        "text": "With and with."
    },
    {
        "text": "Oh, yeah, that's also idea two."
    },
    {
        "text": "Idea two is the good start and then the bad finish for stochastic gradient descent."
    },
    {
        "text": "And of course, the magic words in, even without this, the magic words in computations is early stopping."
    },
    {
        "text": "We don't overfit."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we wanted to stop early anyway."
    },
    {
        "text": "And early stopping just is like a good idea for if that's what the approach to the x star that you're looking for."
    },
    {
        "text": "This would be the place where the, this is where, that's x star where grad f at x star is 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the minimum point."
    },
    {

        "text": "Arg min."
    },
    {
        "text": "Exactly what we're looking for."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we don't find it very well, but we get close to it fast."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. Two ideas on projects."
    },
    {
        "text": "So just, so maybe I'll go to the main topic of today, the topic I promised, the idea of back propagation."
    },
    {
        "text": "To compute, this is all to compute grad f, the gradient, all the derivatives."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is the df dx1 to df dxm, maybe I'll say, where I have m features for the sample."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's back propagation."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's the thing whose discovery or rediscovery put neural nets on the map."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the key calculation, of course, to find the gradient in the steepest descent algorithm."
    },
    {
        "text": "Every step needs a gradient."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if you can't compute it quickly, you're in bad shape."
    },
    {
        "text": "But you can compute it quickly by this automatic differentiation in reverse mode, which is otherwise known."
    },
    {
        "text": "I don't think the people, maybe Hinton was the first, was the leader in developing deep neural nets, deep learning."
    },
    {
        "text": "And he realized, so I give him big credit for that, that back propagation would work and would give him fast gradients."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it actually had been studied before under the name AD, automatic differentiation."
    },
    {
        "text": "So may I just tell you that idea?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Some of you may know it, may know about it, may know more than I, and might know a good website to see this description."
    },
    {
        "text": "There'll be, of course, a section of the book, of the notes."

    },

        "text": "This is section 7.2."

    {
        "text": "So this is the chapter on deep learning."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the first section was about the structure of f of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And you remember the key point about the structure of f of x is that I start with x and apply some function f1 of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And to that, I apply some function f2 of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And to that, I apply some function of f3 of f2 of f1 of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's the thing whose derivative I need."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'll just take ordinary derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, partial derivatives, really, because I better say partial derivatives."
    },
    {
        "text": "So suppose x is a pair xy."
    },

        "text": "Example."
    },
    {
        "text": "Let me show you by example."
    },
    {
        "text": "So suppose f of x is, let me take a simple example, x cubed times x plus 2y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I want to think of that function the way anybody would, as being built as a product of two functions."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there is a product rule to get into the derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then we need the derivatives of each piece."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's a power rule and a linear combination rule."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's got a few of the rules that we use."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the point is to think about the computation of f of x and the computation of df dx and the computation of df dy."
    },
    {
        "text": "Those are the derivatives that we need."
    },
    {
        "text": "This is the function we need."
    },

        "text": "And how to do those computations quickly."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK."
    },
    {
        "text": "So and this is section 7.2, which benefited a lot from a blog."
    },

        "text": "I'm not a blog reader or a blog writer, but somehow I found this blog."

        "text": "And he really writes clear things."

        "text": "He works for one of the big companies and does the deeper research."

    {
        "text": "But he's also a really good expositor."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the website that he now uses is called distill.something."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I think maybe this blog was earlier before the start of distill."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it might be loaded onto distil."
    },
    {
        "text": "Anyway, that's where I got this simple description of backpropagation."
    },
    {
        "text": "And let's just do calculus first of all."
    },
    {
        "text": "If I just have a function of maybe even one variable, what's the derivative?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What is df dx here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Just to remember what calculation we have to do."
    },
    {
        "text": "So df dx, this is with n equal 1, one variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'll use ordinary derivative and not partial derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "But this is then what I, that's what really has to be done."
    },

        "text": "But just what's the derivative of that, of a chain of functions?"

        "text": "Well, of course, the chain rule."
    },

        "text": "I differentiate F3."

        "text": "I don't know, what do I put that it's differentiated with respect to?"

    {
        "text": "F3, df3, df2, is that what I should put?"
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. And where do I evaluate that derivative?"
    },
    {
        "text": "So yeah, I don't evaluate it at x, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm differentiating with respect to F2."
    },
    {
        "text": "So do I evaluate it at F2 of F1 of x?"
    },
    {
        "text": "This is where the chain rule gets sort of a little chainy, a little."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, then we know that df2, df1."
    },
    {
        "text": "And again, that's now evaluated at F1 of x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then the final factor is df1, dx, evaluated at x."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's somehow what we have to do."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's just for an ordinary one variable function."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I have here a two variable function."
    },
    {
        "text": "And deep learning has a million variable function."

        "text": "So let's, I think we won't go to a million, but two we could manage."
    },

        "text": "Let's compute the function, first of all."

        "text": "Compute F. So I'm given x equals, say, 2, and y equals, say, 3."
    },

        "text": "And I'm going to create a computational graph."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is to draw."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm actually going to draw the computational graph to compute for F. And then it'll be a variation of that graph to find the derivatives."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's just start with the graph, first of all, for the function, because we're going to need that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So again, it's x cubed plus."
    },
    {
        "text": "So can I write that function again?"
    },
    {
        "text": "x cubed times x plus 2y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I think we're going to, the first step will be to find x plus x cubed, that factor, which will be 8."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we have to find the other factor, x plus 2y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So then I'm going to, that uses y and x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's a directed graph going forward with this computation."
    },
    {
        "text": "So x plus 2y equals whatever it is, 2 and 6."

    },
    {
        "text": "What shall I change here?"

    {
        "text": "Make it 3y, 3y, just to get a different number here."

        "text": "I get 11."

        "text": "That's a good number, 11."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so far so good?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And now the next step on this graph will be to, I have a product of those."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that will go to the product."

    {
        "text": "Product F equals 8 times 11, 88."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so we got the answer, 88."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which math, normally I wouldn't take that much of a book to compute F. I would have said 2 cubed times 2 plus 3 times 3."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'd have simplified that to 8 times 11."
    },

        "text": "The whole point of AD is that the computation, every computation of a derivative breaks down like this into very simple pieces."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the derivatives of those simple pieces are also simple pieces."
    },

        "text": "So the whole point is to replace appropriately those intermediate steps with derivatives, so as to compute the x derivative."
    },

        "text": "Partial derivatives of x cubed with respect to x is 3x squared."
    },

        "text": "So now I'll put maybe a formula and then a number, so that gives 3 times 4, 12."
