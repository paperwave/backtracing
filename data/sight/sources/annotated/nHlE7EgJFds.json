        "text": "The null space was and the row space was."

        "text": "So here we have the can I make that picture of the row space?"

        "text": "And can I make this kind of picture of the null space?"

    {
        "text": "That's just meant to be a sketch, to remind you that they're in this which, you know, how, what type of vectors are in it?"

        "text": "OK. To understand these spaces is our job now."

        "text": "I have an m by n matrix."
    },

        "text": "The dimension of the column space is the rank, R. We actually got to that at the end of the last lecture, but only for an example."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I really have to say, OK, what's going on there?"
    },
    {
        "text": "I should produce a basis, and then I just look to see how many vectors I needed in that basis, and the answer will be R. Actually, I'll do that before I get on to the others."
    },
    {
        "text": "What's a basis for the column space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "We've done all the work of row reduction, identifying the pivot columns, the ones that have pivots, the ones that end up with pivots, but now I the pivot columns I'm interested in are columns of A, the original A."
    },
    {
        "text": "And those pivot columns, there are R of them, the rank R counts those, those are a basis."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if I answer this question for the column space, the answer will be a basis is the pivot columns, and the dimension is the rank R. And there are pivot columns and everything great."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, so that space we pretty well understand."
    },
    {
        "text": "I probably have a little going back to see that, to prove that this is a right answer, but you know it's the right answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now let me look at the row space."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. Shall I tell you the dimension of the row space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Yes."
    },
    {
        "text": "Before we do even an example, let me tell you the dimension of the row space."
    },
    {
        "text": "Its dimension is also R. The row space and the column space have the same dimension."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's a wonderful fact."
    },
    {
        "text": "The dimension of the column space of A transpose, that's the row space, is R. That space is R-dimensional."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so is this one."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. That's the, that's the sort of insight that got used in this example."
    },
    {
        "text": "If those, if those, if those, are the three columns of a matrix, let me make them the three columns of a matrix by just erasing some brackets, OK, those are the three columns of a matrix, the rank of that matrix, if I look at the columns, it wasn't obvious to me anyway."
    },
    {
        "text": "But if I look at the rows, it's, now it's obvious."
    },
    {
        "text": "The row space of that matrix obviously is two-dimensional, because I can, I see a basis for the row space, this row and that row."
    },
    {
        "text": "And of course, strictly speaking, I'm supposed to transpose those guys, make them stand up."
    },
    {
        "text": "But the rank is two, and therefore the column space is two-dimensional by this wonderful fact that the row space and column space have the same dimension, and therefore there are only two pivot columns, not three, and, those, the three columns are dependent."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. Now, let me bury that error and talk about the row space."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, I'm going to give you the dimensions of all the spaces, because that's the, such a nice answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let me come back here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we have this great fact to establish, that the row space, its dimension is also the rank."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. What about the null space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What's a basis for the null space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "What's the dimension of the null space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Let me, I'll put that answer up here, for the null space."
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, how have we constructed the null space?"
    },
    {
        "text": "We took the matrix A, we did those row operations to get it into a form U or even further, we got it into the reduced form R, and then we read off special solutions."
    },
    {
        "text": "Special solutions, and every special solution came from a free variable."
    },
    {
        "text": "And those special solutions are in the null space, and the great thing is, they're a basis for it."
    },
    {
        "text": "So for the null space, a basis will be the special solutions."
    },
    {
        "text": "And there's one for every free variable, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "For each free variable, we give that variable the value one, the other free variable zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "We get the pivot variables, we get a vector in the -- we get a special solution."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we get all together n minus R of them, because that's the number of free variables."
    },
    {
        "text": "If we have R, this is, the dimension is R, is the number of pivot variables, this is the number of free variables."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the beauty is that those special solutions do form a basis and tell us immediately that the dimension of the null space is n -- I'd better write this well, because it's so nice, n minus R. And you see the nice thing, that the two dimensions in this n-dimensional space, one subspace is R-dimensional, to be proved, that's the row space."
    },
    {
        "text": "The other subspace is n minus R-dimensional, that's the null space."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the two dimensions, like, together, give n. The sum of R and n minus R is n. And that's just great."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's really copying the fact that we have n variables, R of them are pivot variables and n minus R are free variables and n all together."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK. And now what's the dimension of this poor misbegotten fourth subspace?"
    },
    {
        "text": "It's got to be m minus R. The dimension of this left null space, left out practically, is m minus R. Well, that's really just saying that this, again, the sum of that plus that is m. And m is correct."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's the number of columns in A transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "A transpose is just as good a matrix as A."
    },
    {
        "text": "It just happens to be n by m. It happens to have m columns, so it will have m variables, when I go to Ax equals zero, and m of them and R of them will be pivot variables and m minus R will be free variables."
    },
    {
        "text": "A transpose is as good a matrix as A."
    },
    {
        "text": "It follows the same rule that this plus the dimension, this dimension plus this dimension adds up to the number of columns."
    },
    {
        "text": "And over here, A transpose has m columns."
    },
    {
        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "Okay, so I gave you the easy answer, the dimensions."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now can I go back to check on a basis?"
    },
    {
        "text": "We would like to think that, say, the row space."
    },

        "text": "Because we've got a basis for the column space."

        "text": "The pivot columns give a basis for the column space."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now I'm asking you to look at the row space."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I you could say, okay, I can produce a basis for the row space by transposing my matrix, making those columns, then doing elimination, row reduction, and checking out the pivot columns in this transposed matrix."
    },
    {
        "text": "But that means you had to do all that row reduction on A transpose."
    },
    {
        "text": "It ought to be possible, if we take a matrix A, let me take the matrix, maybe we had this matrix in the last lecture, one one one, two one two, three two three, one one one."
    },
    {
        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "text": "That, that matrix was so easy, we spotted its pivot columns, one and two, without actually doing row reduction."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now let's do the job properly."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I subtract this away from this to produce a zero."
    },
    {
        "text": "So one two three one is fine."
    },
    {
        "text": "Subtracting that away leaves me minus one minus one zero, right?"
    },
    {
        "text": "And subtracting that from the last row, oh, well, that's easy."
    },
    {
        "text": "Okay, I'm doing row reduction."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now I've, the first column is all set."
    },
    {
        "text": "The second column, I now see the pivot, and I can clean up, if I, actually, okay, why don't I make the pivot into a one?"

        "text": "I'll multiply that row through by minus one, and then I have one one."
