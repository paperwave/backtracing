    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the first thing we need to know."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the second thing we need to know is the slope."

        "text": "And that's this number m. And in calculus, we have another name for it."

        "text": "We call it f' of x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "Namely, the derivative of f. So that's the calculus part."
    },

        "text": "That's the tricky part."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's the part that we have to discuss now."

        "text": "So just to make that explicit here, I'm going to make a definition."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which is that f' of x0, which is known as the derivative of f, at x0, is the slope of the tangent line to y equals f of x at the point, let's just call it P. So that's what it is."
    },
    {
        "text": "But still I haven't made any progress in figuring out any better how I drew that line."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I have to say something that's more concrete."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because I want to be able to cook up what these numbers are."
    },
    {
        "text": "I have to figure out what this number m is."
    },
    {
        "text": "And one way of thinking about that, let me just try it, is, so I certainly am taking for granted the sort of non-calculus part."
    },
    {
        "text": "That I know what a line through a point is."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I know this equation."
    },
    {
        "text": "But another possibility might be this line here."
    },
    {
        "text": "How do I know, well, unfortunately I didn't draw it quite straight, but there it is."
    },
    {
        "text": "How do I know that this orange line is not a tangent line, but this other line is a tangent line?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Well, it's actually not so obvious."
    },
    {
        "text": "But I'm going to describe it a little bit."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's not really the fact, this thing crosses at some other place."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which is this point q."
    },
    {
        "text": "But it's not really the fact that the thing crosses at two places."
    },
    {
        "text": "Because the line could be wiggly, the curve could be wiggly."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it could cross back and forth a number of times."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's not what distinguishes the tangent line."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I'm going to have to somehow grasp this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'll first do it in language."
    },
    {
        "text": "And it's the following idea."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's that if you take this orange line, which is called a secant line, and you think of the q, the point q is getting closer and closer to p, then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line."
    },
    {
        "text": "And if we draw it close enough, then that's going to be the correct line."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's really what I did, sort of in my brain, when I drew that first line."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so that's the way I'm going to articulate it first now."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the tangent line is equal to the limit of what's so-called secant lines, pq, as q tends to p. And here we're thinking of p as being fixed."
    },
    {
        "text": "And q as varying."
    },
    {
        "text": "Alright, so that's the, again this is still a geometric discussion."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now we're going to be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we'll be able to work out formulas in any example."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's do that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So first of all, I'm going to write out these points p and q again."
    },
    {
        "text": "So maybe we'll put p here and q here."
    },
    {
        "text": "And I'm thinking of this line through them."
    },
    {
        "text": "I guess it was orange, so we'll leave it as orange."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now I want to compute its slope."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so this gradually, we'll do this in two steps."
    },
    {
        "text": "And these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus, including multivariable calculus, across the board."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the first notation that's used is, you imagine, here's the x-axis underneath, and here's the x0, the location directly below the point p. And we're traveling here a horizontal distance, which is denoted by delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's delta x, so-called."
    },
    {
        "text": "And we could also call it the change in x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's one thing we want to measure in order to get the slope of this line p, q."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the other thing is this height."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's this distance here, which we denote delta f, which is the change in f. And then the slope is just the ratio delta f over delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the slope of the secant."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the process I just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself, but also in particular to its slope."
    },
    {
        "text": "And the way we write that is the limit as delta x goes to 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's going to be our slope."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the slope of the tangent line."
    },
    {
        "text": "OK, now this is still a little general, and I want to work out a more usable form here."
    },
    {
        "text": "I want to work out a better formula for this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in order to do that, I'm going to write delta f, the numerator, more explicitly here."
    },
    {
        "text": "The change in f. So remember that the point p is the point x0, f of x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what we got from our formula for the point."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in order to compute these distances, and in particular the vertical distance here, I'm going to have to get a formula for q as well."
    },
    {
        "text": "So if this horizontal distance is delta x, then this location is x0 plus delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so the point above that point has a formula which is x0 plus delta x, f of, and this is a mouthful, x0 plus delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So there's the formula for the point q."
    },
    {
        "text": "Here's the formula for the point p. And now I can write a different formula for the derivative."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which is the following."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this f' of x0, which is the same as m, is going to be the limit as delta x goes to 0 of the change in f. Well, the change in f is the value of f at the upper point here, which is x0 plus delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And minus its value at the lower point, p, which is f of x0, divided by delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "I'm going to put this in a little box, because this is by far the most important formula today, which we use to derive pretty much everything else."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is the way that we're going to be able to compute these numbers."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's do an example."
    },
    {
        "text": "This example, so we'll call this example 1."
    },
    {
        "text": "We'll take the function f of x, which is 1 over x."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's sufficiently complicated to have an interesting answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "And sufficiently straightforward that we can compute the derivative fairly quickly."
    },
    {
        "text": "So what is it that we're going to do here?"
    },
    {
        "text": "All we're going to do is we're going to plug in this formula here for that function."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's all we're going to do."
    },
    {
        "text": "And visually, what we're accomplishing is somehow to take the hyperbola, and take a point on the hyperbola, and figure out some tangent line."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's what we're accomplishing when we do that."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we're accomplishing this geometrically, but we'll be doing it algebraically."
    },
    {
        "text": "So first, we consider this difference, delta f over delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "And write out its formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "So I have to have a place, so I'm going to make it again above this point x0, which is a general point."
    },
    {
        "text": "We'll make the general calculation."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the value of f at the top, when we move to the right by f of x, so I just read off from this, read off from here the formula."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first thing I get here is 1 over x0 plus delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the left-hand term."
    },
    {
        "text": "Minus 1 over x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's the right-hand term."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then I have to divide that by delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here's our expression."
    },
    {
        "text": "And by the way, this has a name."
    },
    {
        "text": "This thing is called a difference quotient."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's pretty complicated because there's always a difference in the numerator."
    },
    {
        "text": "And in disguise, the denominator is a difference because it's the difference between the value on the right side and the value on the left side here."
    },
    {
        "text": "So now we're going to simplify it by some algebra."
    },
    {
        "text": "So let's just take a look."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is equal to, let's continue on the next level here, this is equal to 1 over delta x times, now all I'm going to do is put it over a common denominator."
    },
    {
        "text": "So the common denominator is x0 plus delta x times x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so in the numerator, for the first expression, I have x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And for the second expression, I have x0 plus delta x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this is the same thing as I had in the numerator before."
    },
    {
        "text": "Factoring out this denominator."
    },
    {
        "text": "And here I put that numerator into this more amenable form."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now there are two basic cancellations."
    },
    {
        "text": "The first one is that x0 and x0 cancel."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we have this."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then the second step is that these two expressions cancel."
    },
    {
        "text": "The numerator and denominator, now we have a cancellation that we can make use of."
    },
    {
        "text": "So we'll write that under here."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is equals minus 1 over x0 plus delta x times x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And then the very last step is to take the limit as delta x tends to 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And now we can do it."
    },
    {
        "text": "Before we couldn't do it."
    },
    {
        "text": "Why?"
    },
    {
        "text": "Because the numerator and the denominator gave us 0 over 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "But now that I've made this cancellation, I can pass to the limit."
    },
    {
        "text": "And all that happens is I set this delta x equal to 0, and I get minus 1 over x0 squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "So that's the answer."
    },
    {
        "text": "So in other words, what I've shown, let me put it up here, is that f' x0 is minus 1 over x0 squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, let's look at the graph just a little bit to check this for plausibility."
    },
    {
        "text": "What's happening here is, first of all, it's negative."
    },
    {
        "text": "It's less than 0."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which is a good thing."
    },
    {
        "text": "You see that slope there is negative."

    {
        "text": "We know that y0 is f x0, and f x is 1 over x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So this thing is 1 over x0."
    },
    {
        "text": "And that's equal to minus 1 over x0 squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "And here's x, and here's x0."

        "text": "So in order to find this x value, I have to plug in one equation into the other."

        "text": "Let's put, let's see, this is minus x over x0 squared."
    },
    {
        "text": "And this is plus 1 over x0, because the x0 and x0 squared cancel somewhat."
    },
    {
        "text": "And so if I put this on the other side, I get x divided by x0 squared is equal to 2 over x0."

    {
        "text": "That's what that one is."

        "text": "So this one is 2y0."

        "text": "And the reason I know this is the following."

    {
        "text": "It involves the exchange of x, y with y, x."
    },
    {
        "text": "So it's trading the roles of x and y."
    },

        "text": "So the symmetry that I'm using is that any formula I get that involves x's and y's, if I trade all the x's and replace them by y's, and trade all the y's and replace them by x's, then I'll have a correct formula on the other way."

        "text": "That's because the, that's just an accident of this equation."
    },
    {
        "text": "That's because, so the symmetry explained is that the equation is y equals 1 over x."
    },
    {
        "text": "But that's the same thing as xy equals 1, if I multiply through by x."
    },
    {
        "text": "Which is the same thing as x equals 1 over y."
    },
    {
        "text": "So here's where the x and the y get reversed."
    },
    {
        "text": "Now, if you don't trust this explanation, you can also get the y-intercept by plugging x equals 0 into the equation star."
    },
    {
        "text": "We plugged y equals 0 in, and we got the x value."
